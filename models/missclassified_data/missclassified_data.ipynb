      "This novel starts off intriguing and fresh. Maybe I was a sucker for a young narrator and old school pop music references. And then. I got really annoyed by the writing. The sentences. Short and fragmented. For no reason. But I slogged. Slogged through it.I thought I would find the flashbacks to The Transition years interesting, but they became tedious and repetitive, and I began to dread them. The \"now\" sections are faster paced, but become absurd eventually, a thriller plot that isn't well thought out. The author is trying to have some deep thoughts about justice versus peace, but it's obvious where he stands and it ends up being polemical and alienating to those who don't share his views. Maybe there's also too much tell not show, like of course the reader will agree with the author on why the bad guys are bad. No nuance needed. But if a post scarcity, worker-owned zero carbon society isn't good enough, then maybe that's a you problem, Kristina.

      "The Great Transition is not a book I would typically choose (dystopian climate fiction), but it came highly recommended. And, I am so glad I branched out. Thank you to NetGalledy, Atria Books, and Cindy Burnett at Thoughts from a Page for the advanced ecopy of this book. Expected pub date is August 15, 2023.Larch and Kristina are two heroes of the Great Transition with numerous deployments and assignments as they strive towards achieving net-zero emissions for the entire planet. When this is achieved, it is called Day Zero and is marked annually with celebrations. The two marry and have a daughter, Emi. The story is told from their perspectives in reflecting on whether Day Zero actually marks the end of the battle or if there is still work to be done. An interesting perspective with some strong political views told in a creative way.\n",

An awkward amount of time spent with the protagonist’s inner brain on disordered eating (like a fine topic and all but both tended to the pro-ana talking points and just seemed to be the only way for the author to express her worries).

      "I had to write this book to write one scene, which I saw clearly in my mind. Holly attending her mother’s zoom funeral. I didn’t have a story to go with it, which was unfortunate, but I kept my feelers out because I loved Holly from the first and wanted to be with her again. Then one day I read a newspaper story about an honor killing. I didn’t think that could be my story, but I loved the headline, which was something like this: everyone thought they were a sweet old couple until the bodies began turning up in the backyard. Killer old folks, I thought. That’s my story. - from Author’s NoteHolly Gibney, partner in the Finders Keepers Detective Agency she inherited from Bill Hodges, (of the Bill Hodges trilogy, in which Holly first appeared) is called in by a distraught mother, Penny Dahl. Her daughter, Bonnie, has been missing for three weeks, and the police are at the point of washing their hands of the case. A peculiar, ambiguous note had been found on her bicycle. But there was no helmet found. Curious, no? Stephen King - image from New Hampshire Magazine – illustrated by John R. GoodwinHolly is on her own, as her partner is laid up with COVID. She has just attended her mother’s funeral. So Holly is emotionally laid low. People close to her have urged her to take some time to grieve. Still, a case might be a way to keep moving, so the game is afoot. It is not long before another missing person case shows up in her research, and another. Tough to prove, but Holly suspects there is a serial killer at work. The book opens with\n",
      "It's an old city, and no longer in very good shape, nor is the lake beside which it has been built, but there are parts of it that are still pretty nice. Longtime residents would probably agree that the nicest section is Sugar Heights, and the nicest street running through it is Ridge Road, which makes a gentle downhill curve from Bell College of Arts and Sciences to Deerfield Park, two miles below. On its way, Ridge Road passes many fine houses, some of which belong to college faculty and some to the city's more successful businesspeople—doctors, lawyers, bankers, and top-of-the-pyramid business executives. Most of these homes are Victorians, with impeccable paintjobs, bow windows, and lots of gingerbread trim.\n",
      "Hmmm, maybe King was not quite done with thought processes from his novel, Fairy Tale. One of those Victorians is home to a couple of octogenarians, mostly-retired professors at the nearby Bell University. They seem ok to a brief glance, but spend time with either one and you might feel the urge to pop up and say, “check please.” Both are considered, at the very least, odd, by those who know them. Some find them creepy. They are far worse.Holly is assisted in her investigation by two associates from prior cases. Jerome and Barbara Robinson are both game to help, but both have other things going on, so are not entirely available. This is a crucial element in sustaining tension, (along with hoping Holly can figure out what is going on in time to save Bonnie) as their disconnection from Holly keeps her from figuring everything out much sooner. What happens if you have, among the team, all the pieces to the puzzle but simply cannot get them all on the table at the same time? The story proceeds as, um, a procedural. Discover this clue, follow it, find another clue, follow that, and so on. Keep the unconnected breadcrumbs floating about in one’s consciousness until it becomes clear where they lead. There is nothing paranormal going on in this one, although abnormal would certainly fit.Two time-lines swap back and forth. In the present, July 2021, Holly pursues her investigation. In the other we flash back to each of the victims, who they were, how they were taken, and how they were treated once captured. King wrote this book during the height of the COVID pandemic, and wanted to make that a major part of the novel. We encounter Holly when she is disconnecting from her mother’s funeral. She, and others, had attended via Zoom. Mom was a diehard, literally, anti-vaxer. Buh-bye. And from what Holly expresses about the dearly departed, she is not all that sad to see her go. Throughout the story, Holly has to decide, mask-or-no-mask, for every interview. Shake hands or bump elbows? She is maybe OCD, or even somewhere on the autism spectrum, but she certainly has an enhanced intuition that some think might be a form of the shining made famous in the book by that name. Maybe she is just a really gifted detective? There is no overt diagnosing of Holly’s abilities or limitations in the book. In addition to the presence of COVID, King offers looks at a range of people and their political attitudes. A bowling alley manager is a full-on conspiracy theorist. Emily Harris’s diverse bigotries are baked in. Speaking of bigotries, one that 76-year-old King addresses is ageism. It usually manifests in presuming the elderly to be incapable of or disinterested in this or that based simply on their age. This is a bit of bias that Holly shares, to her own peril. \n",
      "I know that there are a lot of people out there on X, or whatever you want to call it, that are convinced that Covid is over and it’s not a going concern anymore. What do you think of that idea?Well, Holly’s mother is a Covid denier, and she dies in the hospital of Covid. And to the very end, she’s saying, “I’ve just got the flu. The flu is what I have.” And I think that it goes back to this is not a new thing. There have been people for years who have just been vaccination deniers who say that if you get a vaccination for a certain kind of thing, you’re going to cause birth defects in your children, this and that. Or if you vaccinate your children, they could have strokes. And you see the same things about the Covid vaccinations. There’s this constant story that thousands of people are dying of heart disease because of the vaccinations. It’s not true, but it’s gained a lot of credence. So there’s a lot of that. And I tried to put that in the book. There are characters in the book who just say, “I don’t believe in this bullshit. It’s all crap.” And that’s the life that we live. And I always try to reflect the time that I’m writing in. – from the Rollingstone interviewIt is easy to root for Holly Gibney as she struggles to learn the truth. This keeps us interested in the book. King is right to keep going back to her. (this is the sixth time) She is sooooo engaging. But there is another course in this meal. King points out how holding false beliefs can lead to mayhem, even death. It certainly did for Holly’s mom, and there is at least one criminal motivation in here that is based on a non-COVID-related disproven theory. This may not be to everyone’s taste. “I’ve had enough” was the note left on Bonnie Dahl’s bicycle. But I bet that by the time you finish reading Holly you will be hungry for a second helping. \n",
      "The outsider masquerading as Terri Maitland was evil. So was the one masquerading as Chet Ondowsky. The same was true of Brady Hartsfield, who found a way to go on doing dirt (Bill’s phrase) even after he should have been rendered harmless. Rendered that way by Holly herself. But Roddy and Emily Harris were worse.\n",

      "3.50 Stars. That was quite the ride. I was super excited about this book. If you’ve followed my reviews for any time period, you will know how much I love paranormal anything, plus book horror. So naturally, all of Grady’s books have looked right up my alley but unfortunately, I just have not had the time to read them. I did watch My Best Friend's Exorcism, and didn’t really care for it, but I heard many people say the book was so much better so it’s still on the list to read eventually. Anyway, when I saw this new book, a book about a haunted house by Grady, I thought the stars aligned because even better than a haunted person, is a good old fashion haunted house. I could not request this book fast enough I was so excited. It is not until two weeks ago that I read the blurb right before I was ready to start the book that I realize that this wasn’t really a modern Grady spin on an old school fashion haunted house story, this was Grady’s spin on object possession, aka creepy f@cking dolls/puppets. I don’t know what it is about old dolls with dead eyes, but I think I watched too many ghost, reality shows about those real dolls that are supposedly cursed or have demons attached or whatever but I just can’t with them. I mean they made movies off of these real dolls they are so scary, heck I couldn’t even watch the new Chucky show since possessed dolls bother me so much now, while I remember back in the day watching Bride of Chucky with no issues, just to support Jennifer Tilly like any queer gen Xer young woman would. How was I, with this possessed doll phobia, going to read Grady’s new book when I knew he was going to push it to the max? Well this is why this review is a bit late because I could not decide what to do. I finally decided to read it and if it was to much, skim or DNF. I’m happy to announce that I was able to read the whole thing. There were two scenes I did fast read, but I was able to get through everything. The horror wasn’t scary per say, it was intense and weird and the book actually had a vibe of Chucky, but the story was completely different. When it came to the story itself, I thought it was okay. I liked Grady’s writing and found it very easy to get lost in the book, even with a subject I actively disliked. Besides the horror parts, the main storyline really is about the relationship of a brother and sister who don’t get along and in fact can’t stand each other. You find yourself instantly siding with one character, and you soon find out that there are always two sides to every story, and I thought Grady did a really good job on showing that. There are some twists and turns in this book and while they are not too surprising, they are definitely fun to read. In the end, I don’t think people will claim this is Grady’s best, but I do think it was an entertaining slightly above average read. If you are a Grady fan or love Childs Play, Chucky, or just creepy dolls and puppets, than this just might be the horror book for you.

      "**Many thanks to Shelf Awareness, Berkley, and Carissa Orlando for an ARC of this book via NetGalley! Now available as of 9.5!** police_car_light  Warning: Outlier Review Ahead!  police_car_light When Margaret and her husband Hal find the PERFECT gothic house, they are willing to overlook a LOT. Flaws in the wood, cracks in the paint...anything can be repaired, and they are prepared to start the next chapter of their lives. As new empty nesters with their daughter Katherine off at college, the house feels like the perfect project to keep them occupied AND a place to create new memories together. So what if things feel a bit...off?Until September arrives...bringing bloody walls and bloody WAILS along with it.After 4 years of living in this terror, Hal is ready to head for the hills...but Margaret is steadfast in her resolve. After all, this is HER house, and she's open to sharing it...even with ghosts. If she can follow the rules, then THEY can too. But when her daughter Katherine arrives after panicking when she doesn't hear back from her father, Margaret wonders if she can maintain her relationships with her haunted house guests AND keep them away from her daughter...and she's more than curious about exactly what became of Hal too. Why exactly are there blocks of time she just can't remember? Can she keep her delicate balance without putting Katherine in danger? Or is the house desperate to keep its secrets...and make Margaret and Katherine PERMANENT residents?Gothic stories and haunted house stories are hit or miss for me. I'm a sucker for ghosts, but they need to be SOMEWHAT believable, terrifying ghosts. And for a while, I was very hopeful that the ghosts in this house would be enough to make this story truly work for me. There are several intriguing haunts to choose from, each with a unique personality and some (minor) backstory. But while Orlando created a perfect atmospheric house of haunts, I realized early on that she also planned this to read as dark humor...and for me, it just didn't. I didn't find the byplay between Margaret and her various ghostly companions that interesting...more like run of the mill chatter. Since it was so accepted that the ghosts were part of every day life for Margaret, they sort of lost their spook factor at times and weren't really cracking me up either...and since this was such a huge piece of the narrative, I had a hard time connecting to the plot for most of the book.There's also the character of daughter Katherine, who I found obnoxious at best, a priest willing to try to shake the ghosts from the walls, and a couple of unimportant detectives to round out the group...but again, nobody felt memorable in a GOOD way. I was only half invested in the missing persons aspect of the book, so it didn't really matter to me what had happened to Margaret's husband. Head Spook Master Vale was creepy, sure, but I had trouble believing that Margaret would put up with all of this craziness JUST to stay in her home..even with the extra incentive provided by Orlando to explain her actions. If you're patient enough to get through all of this, the last 20% of this book DOES pick up and goes into more surprising territory, so much so that I almost bumped up my rating on that alone. After some time to sit with my thoughts, though, I don't feel like this bit of bait and switch tacked on at the end was QUITE enough to make up for the pacing and the lack of excitement I felt along the way.Though we are just heading into spooky season, this 'early' horror release is sure to spook and delight many gothic horror fans. This debut may be a bit rough around the edges, Orlando shows a lot of promise. I just think in this case her main character Margaret could have taken a little advice from Green Day....and have someone just wake her up when September ends.  person_in_bed 3.5 stars\n",

      "Mariana Enriquez’s ambitious novel reads like a subversion of the magical-realist, family saga once so strongly associated with Latin American fiction, here transformed into epic, commercial horror. Enriquez’s work’s been labelled  “a cocktail of politics and cult horror.”  In interviews she’s attributed her fascination with combining the two to the particular evils of Argentina’s political past,  “There’s something about the scale of the cruelty in political violence from the state that always seems like the blackest magic to me. Like they have to satisfy some ravenous and ancient god that demands not only bodies but needs to be fed their suffering as well.”  An observation that essentially sums up the underlying plot of her award-winning book. It’s an unsettling, macabre story that shifts around in time and between voices and styles – sometimes consciously literary, sometimes direct and unpolished, sometimes closer to pulp fiction. Just like her earlier work, Enriquez builds on elements taken from Argentinian mythologies from folklore to folk horror to gods and saints. All of which are contained within a narrative that displays the influence of her favourite writers from Stephen King to China Miéville. The central section, featuring characters first encountered in Enriquez’s short stories, echoes aspects of It; while others have a more fantastical feel. At its heart are the machinations of a family whose immense wealth has given them equally-immense power within Argentinian society. This secretive clan are also founders of a global cult, The Order; seeking the key to immortality by accessing an amorphous force known as “the darkness.” To achieve their goal, successive generations have ruthlessly exploited the poor and vulnerable, both as fodder for, and conduits to, a supposedly-demonic realm. During the time of the Junta in the 70s and 80s, the family flourishes, their savagery unremarkable against a backdrop of brutal political oppression, mass murders, torture and disappearances. The wider political environment is highlighted throughout, with storylines explicitly building on news items like the slow death of Omayra Sanchez Garzon that played out on television screens across the country; or the unearthing of the mass graves left behind after the fall of the military dictatorship. AIDs, protest movements, labour unrest, hyperinflation and the economic crises of the 80s and 90s, all play a role in Enriquez’s characters’ lives. Even The Order and its obsession with the supernatural brings to mind prominent figures in Argentina’s history like the sinister José López Rega, aka El Brujo, one-time advisor to Perón. Enriquez’s attention to historical detail is both a strength and a weakness, at least for me. At various stages, Enriquez piles on the gore, carefully documenting The Order’s perverse rituals and routine cruelties - sometimes to near-absurd levels. Yet I found the brutality and horror of Argentina’s actual history ultimately far more potent and chilling than Enriquez’s portrayal of supernatural events. Although, I suppose it’s possible that’s one of the points she’s trying to make here. It’s not a subtle piece, some episodes are fluid and gripping, others a little clunky. The pacing’s also fairly uneven, and the later sections are a bit too narrowly descriptive, long-drawn-out, stilted and breathless at the same time. Although I’m more than happy I read this, from my perspective it would definitely benefit from further editing. I don’t think the length is entirely justified, there’s just too much mundane detail, and unnecessary repetition. Translated by Megan McDowell. Part-title illustrations by Pablo Gerardo Camacho.

      "Mi parte de día¿Qué bombazo esta novela, no? Bastó que pusiera por acá que empezaba a leerla para que me llovieran los likes. En una encuestita tuitera tuvo muchos votos como la mejor ficción argentina del Siglo XXI. Yo, lamentablemente, no puedo ser parte de esa euforia, básicamente, por una cuestión de género. \"No hay géneros malos, hay buena o mala literatura nomás\" dice una frase muy conocida. Esa frase tiene un correlato que implica que en cada género puede surgir una obra maestra, no solo en la literatura, sino también en las otras artes como el cine o la música. Yo no soy muy fanático de las novelas gráficas, sin embargo, cuando leí Maus de Art Spiegelman sentí el deslumbre de las obras maestras. Pensaba que con este libro me iba a pasar lo mismo. Que por primera vez me iba a impactar una novela de un género que no me gusta nada; el terror o, si se quiere la fantasía. Pero no me pasó. Me parece un hallazgo que haya metido este submundo de médiums y ocultistas en los tiempos de la última dictadura argentina. Imagino que esos años de desapariciones, torturas y asesinatos, la más oscura de nuestra historia, fue una temporada altísima para quiénes practican o creen en los vínculos con lo que vaporosamente se llama \"el más allá\". Yo, tal vez híperracionalista, no puedo dejar de ver todo eso como una gran estupidez. Y este sentimiento me acompañó en la lectura de toda la novela.Pensaba mientras la leía que, al revés del efecto buscado, que sería más que nada asustar más y mejor, este género rebaja el dolor y el morbo. Digo, si te cuentan de chicos mutilados, viejos torturados y cosas por el estilo, por efecto de un monstruo, pierde fuerza contra, por ejemplo, que te cuenten de un nene que efectivamente se hizo un raspón al caerse de la bicicleta. Sobre el final, por poner un caso, se cuenta que al protagonista \"le arrancaron las uñas\", así sin más, y después todo sigue como si nada.Me pasó además algo horrible. Cuando me faltaban unas 100 páginas para terminarla tuve que suspender la lectura para preparar unos exámenes. Cuando la retomé 10 días después, me di cuenta de que no me importaba nada lo que estaba leyendo, no volví a entrar en clima. Quien sabe, tal vez dentro de unos años, esta novela persista en mi memoria más que el promedio. Le voy a hacer el peor elogio posible a una novela: deberían hacer una película o una serie con esta historia. No me extrañaría que alguien haya comprado los derechos, ya. Sería un stranger things meets el Pombero. Yo no la vería, pero sería un exitazo.Ahora, yo escribo todo esto, pero esta novela es tal vez el último boom argentino. Muchos creen que es lo mejor que se escribió en el país en este siglo XXI. No por nada le dieron el Premio Herralde, además. Llegué a esta novela porque se la regalé a mi sobrina, fanática de Stephen King, que me dijo que era el mejor libro que había leído en su vida. Después pasó por mi suegra y miqueridaesposa, a las que también les gustó mucho.- Ahora, si sabías que iba a hacer así de la primera oración a la última, ¿Para qué la seguiste leyendo hasta el final? me preguntó hace unos días Miqueridaesposa- Para escribir una reseña en Goodreads - fue mi tímida y ridícula respuesta.==Si te gustan mis reseñas tal vez también te guste mi newsletter sobre libros que se llama \"No se puede leer todo\".

      "When Vesper turned 18, she left her rural life and religious family for New York City and never turned back. When Vesper left she was told that once she left the deeply religious community she was no longer welcome back.Seven years later, she receives an invitation to her best friend Rosie and her ex boyfriend Brody’s wedding. Vesper’s mom Constance is a horror film star and has always treated Vesper very coldly. Even though she’s not in an rush to return the toxic environment she escaped, something on the inside is pulling her to go. Another highly entertaining story from Rachel Harrison! I can always count on her for an original page turner. I devoured this book in less than 24 hours. Similar to her prior works, Black Sheep is equal parts dark humor, and horror, centered around a badass female main character. Thanks to Rachel’s incredible writing, so much of the story felt real. This book read just like a movie playing. And even though there are a few feel good moments in the story, the horror aspects were absolutely terrifying. Black Sheep by Rachel Harrison will be available on September 12. A massive thanks to Berkley Pub and Netgalley for the gifted copy!\n",

      "It pains me to do this because I loved My Heart is a Chainsaw so much. But Don't Fear the Reaper is a massive letdown. I nearly DNF'ed so many times.Missing from this were all the things I enjoyed about the first: an endearing MC (Jade), an intriguing premise, a coherent plot, logical slasher references. Instead of focusing on Jade, the author dumps the reader into way too many POVs. Most of them boring throwaways. As a result, the plot was muddled and the effort tedious for the reader. Speaking of Jade, she decides to go by Jennifer, then back to Jade. And you remember that cool thing she did in the first by recalling all the slasher references and applying them to real life situations? Yeah, she gave that up here. Instead, EVERY OTHER CHARACTER has spent the past 4 years becoming slasher experts. It was endearing in Jade's mind in the first, but this was forced and silly.You will also need to remember a lot of details from the first to understand what is going on. A literary version of \"previously on\" would've been helpful. I spent much of this confused, which likely impacted my enjoyment. Don't even get me started on the serial killer Dark Mill South, which sounds more like an abandoned mall or a rapper's stage name. This way too long, too unfocused, too boring. Felt more like I was reading a parody of a slasher, like the Scary Movie franchise. Then there's a random demonic elk thing that had me thinking of those corny Amazon B-movies (Sharknado, Llamageddon, Lavalantula)  rolling_on_the_floor_laughing \n",

      "The cover tells us that this is the second book in The Indian Lake Trilogy, and I'd say that reading My Heart Is a Chainsaw, the first volume, before this one is necessary to get all of what's happening here. It's a great read, but not an easy one; you have to keep track and pay attention to the details, or you'll get lost fast. There are multiple point-of-view shifts and a lot of different characters popping in and out, and sometimes even they aren't completely sure of who they are. (Jennifer or Jade? Ginger or Cinnamon?) Jones knows and loves and respects and pays homage to the tropes and traditions and conceits of the horror/slasher genre and mixes it all with Native American philosophy and Final Girl mentality quite brilliantly. There are some stream-of-consciousness sequences that I found hard to follow, but I took my time reading it and enjoyed it very much. I'm ready for the final book!\n",

      "Jones' Don't Fear the Reaper is not necessarily connected to Blue Oyster Cult's masterpiece of the same name, although Romeo and Juliet never experienced the bloody aftermath of ProofRock, the cute little town in the mountains by the lake. Don’t Fear the Reaper is the page-turning sequel to My Heart Is a Chainsaw and it is billed as part two of the trilogy, meaning that somehow there are enough living breathing souls left in the small mountain lake town to have one more bite at the apple. Maybe? Nevertheless, each one of these books in this trilogy is fairly self-contained and you may dare venture into Reaper without devouring the first of the series, although you are missing some background, some history, some massacres. Reaper is Jones' second book in this love affair with horror movies and you had best familiarize yourself with the genre if you are going to get all the inside jokes. This one also stars Jade Daniels, now having returned to town after four years in custody, awaiting trial for the fiasco at the lake that was the previous book. Four years changes a lot. Dorothy, you are not in Kansas anymore, and you are not in high school. Those four years removed gives Jade perspective and she can function without necessarily the same kinds of relationships with people. That's good because she is doubtless going to loose a lot of these people in her battle with the slashers and serial killers.\n",

      "It is wonderful to see Tananarive Due quickly becoming a household name for the horror reader – she deserves it. The Reformatory, which is based on the events of the Dozier School for Boys and follows little Robert Stephens unjustly landing in this hell, as well as his sister Gloria's sturdy efforts to get him out of there, is just further proof of her writing talent and narrative aptitude. Due does everything right in this utterly moving book.\n",

      "When I took notice of this book I must not have paid close enough attention because I mistook it for a memoir. While the author is a violinist in real life, this novel is about a child prodigy pianist and is a work of fiction. And what a work of fiction it was, because as I kept reading I kept saying in my mind, \"This is wild!!\" over and over again. This is a first person narration from an only child, a daughter of Chinese immigrants who were both pianists. They live very simple lives and struggle to exist in America, and give piano lessons in their New Jersey home for a living. The daughter's talent as a pianist is so exquisite that her YouTube practice sessions catapult her to a full ride at a NYC Conservatory. This all comes to a halt after a tragic incident one evening after a concert. Now the young woman (we never learn her actual name) is washing dishes in a restaurant for a living, piano playing abandoned, when she is tapped to work at Holistik, an elite wellness center/spa. What unfolds is much more than meets the eye as she first starts working at this facility. How far will people go to project and achieve beauty? I marveled at the creativity of this author as she gradually lured you into this world of organic oddities. The breadth of the imagination seemed limitless with carnal acts and manipulation that were shocking. I don't want to give any more detail away, but this was one wild ride!\n",

      "I wanted to eat them all.I must have had the wrong expectations going into Monstrillo, especially it being listed as horror made me expect a book that aims at scaring, disturbing, unsettling but having finished it now, I unfortunately feel underwhelmed. I don't want to say I was disappointed, but I was in a way since the story of a boy, raised from the one lung of his parents' deceased son, a little human eating monster who was made into a human who returned to being a monster, didn't really hit me hard enough. This book is more about grief than anything else, and the crazy things we do while it has us in its grip.The narration is divided into four parts; mother Magos, father Joseph, family friend Lena and finally M and the whole ordeal is rather tragic than terrifying. I have a soft spot for stories of beings who try to defy their natures and become conform, become someone else, and yet what I was offered wasn't enough for me, it was almost boring to me. I wish the whole story were narrated from the point of view of M, that would have been more exciting.I also can't warm up to books that don't have dialogue markers. It would have been a star less if one chapter wasn't set in Berlin.\n",

      "EXCERPT: A Current Affair transcript (August 15, 1988)MAURY POVICH: Edgewood, Maryland. A small, peaceful working-class town nestled on the shores of Chesapeake Bay. Little League baseball parades and Fourth of July carnivals. The kind of place where people don't bother to lock their doors at night. [in a deeper voice] Edgewood, Maryland . . . a close-knit community now held hostage in a death grip of terror and paranoia. Three young girls. Savagely beaten and murdered. The killer has been christened the \"Boogeyman\" because of his ability to strike close to home and vanish without a trace. As one frustrated lawman lamented soon after the discovery of the latest victim: 'It's like the guy sliced open a hole in the night and disappeared back into it.'ABOUT 'BECOMING THE BOGEYMAN': Back in the summer of 1988, a young Richard Chizmar was catapulted into the centre of a living nightmare as the serial killer Joshua Gallagher - dubbed by the media as 'The Boogeyman' - stalked his tranquil Maryland town.These days, Chizmar enjoys a certain level of notoriety himself as he is the only person to whom Josh Gallagher will talk, on or off the record. Chizmar likes to visit Gallagher in prison, as there are plenty of other nameless victims out there and Gallagher's confession would bring closure to grieving loved ones.But when a masked figure leaves a horrifying calling card in the front of his home, Chizmar finds there is a price for dancing with the devil. It's clear that there is a new player controlled by the Boogeyman.MY THOUGHTS: I have to say that when I began this book, I didn't like it. I really didn't like it. I didn't like the writing style; I didn't like the format - it reads like a true crime book and is accompanied by photos of the victims, the kill sites and various other pertinent people and places. But somewhere around the 20% mark, I became hooked and read the remainder of the book voraciously. By the time I got to the end, I was convinced that this was a true crime book and it was only the author's notes at the end which convinced me otherwise. The author weaves a lot of his own life into the fabric of Becoming the Boogeyman which only strengthens the feeling that this isn't a work of fiction. I kept wondering where the truth ended and the fiction began, if it did at all - the lines are very blurred.Richard Chizmar is a very clever writer making use of social media, interviews, book reviews, and message boards to add authenticity to his story. It works - almost too well! The only thing I found lacking was the 'creep' factor - it just didn't come across for me. But there is plenty of tension to carry the read.One thing, Mr Chizmar - you refer to a joke about a horny nun and an alligator. I wish you'd shared it. I haven't read the author's previous novel, Chasing the Boogeyman, but I didn't find that held me back at all. That's not to say, of course, that I'm not going to go back and read it because I probably will. I will also be standing in line for the next in the series. I am impressed! star  star  star  star .1#BecomingtheBoogeyman #NetGalleyTHE AUTHOR: Besides writing, Richard Chizmar also edits anthologies, produces films, writes screenplays, and teaches writing.

      "Initial ThoughtsI really liked this book! It took me a very long time to make my way through this story but that had everything to do with my life and nothing to do with the book. I was a bit surprised to learn that there would be a follow up to Chasing the Boogeyman but I was eager to get my hands on it. This book is told from the same style of fiction written like true crime as the first book. I loved that the story kept me guessing until the very end. I would definitely recommend this one to other readers.Review copy provided by the publisher. Full review to be posted soon.\n",

      "Her Little Flowers by Shannon MorganGothic mystery. Dual time line. Francine has lived in her ancestral home her whole life. She lives alone but occasionally rents out rooms for the income. She converses regularly with Bree, a mischievous ghost that lives in a tree on the property. Other ghosts are in the house but Francine is familiar with them and also is very knowledgeable about plants and their protective powers. When her sister Madeleine returns for a visit, everything changes for Francine. New menacing ghosts, and memories of having brothers and sisters including Bree start an investigation into their past and an abusive father. Suspenseful and a bit old fashioned, the story moves well and kept me reading. The healing and protective powers of plants was interesting. The family secrets are sad and I understand why Francine would want to forget everything. I received a copy of this from the publisher and @BetweenTheChapters.\n",

A layer of passion towards nature, a layer of being part of our surroundings.Her protagonists are marvellously middle aged in the middle of a ghost story, a story of family, love and hate and consequences and new beginnings.I wouldn't label this as a horror story, rather a story with ghosts.An ARC gently provided by author/publisher via Netgalley.\n",

      "Shannon Morgan created an inviting gothic tone through her gorgeous writing in this ghostly suspense, although it was not unblemished prose. I did find myself perturbed by the superfluous word usage, but that proved to be the least of my concerns in the end. The mystery of Her Little Flowers was a unique one and that did help me stay invested in this story. While the tale was not one with spooky apparitions that made me question the creaking of my own old house, it did succeed in encompassing dark content. I struggled, however, to embrace the characters. They never felt real to me. The two sisters’ personalities were amplified extremes lacking nuance, but I found it even harder to buy into the glimpses of the past, as the little girls were far too astute to convince me that they were children. I wasn’t particularly fond of the romantic aspect, either. It felt forced and underdeveloped, plus I wasn’t really impressed with Todd. I hated the way he kept casting doubt onto the secrets and theories Francine shared with him. He seemed emotionally unsupportive, and he was a bit of a mansplainer. I was not rooting for their spark to grow into a flame. SPOILERS:I do wish the suspense hadn’t kept me tied to the narrative, as I don’t feel the reveals were worth the time I devoted to this book. While so much within that ending felt silly to me, I was especially disappointed in the mystery regarding the three missing sisters. I’m all for suspending disbelief when it’s called for, but this was ludicrous. Am I really supposed to accept that those little girls didn’t make any noise, didn’t choose to give up their hiding spot, and just stayed in one place until they died? And then no one caught a whiff of their decomposing bodies?! Really? The implausibility of it all was just too much for me. Had I trusted my instincts early on, I never would have finished this book. But I convinced myself that the story held promise and I rode it out to see how the mystery unraveled, only to find myself crushed under the heavy weight of regret.I am immensely grateful to Bibliolifestyle and Kensington for my copy. All opinions are my own.\n",

      "Nothing about this worked for me. I considered DNF-ing at 90% but I thought that was silly. But then it got worse, so there you go. Really contrived gothic atmosphere - so many elements thrown in (child ghosts, abandoned asylum) but none of them actually had feeling attached to them, which is what actually makes something gothic.All my spoiler-y thoughts below:-I never want to hear the name \"Bree\" again. So many times! Not sure if this was as annoying in print, but it was maddening on audio.-Why did Tom Constable (his name was something like that) even like about Francine? It made no sense that he was interested in her. Or why he was in the story. -Her mom was a witch? I wanted more of this or none at all.-Her dad went back to the house after the asylum because he couldn't deal with the fact that he wasn't going to get the house now that their son was dead? Mmm okay I guess.-What did the last 50 years of Francine's life even look like?? I don't get what she does.-So F lives alone in this old house that then also ends up having an abandoned asylum and a graveyard on the property? What? Why?-Who cares that her sister had so many husbands?-And so I waited out this whole book to find out that three little kids died in a horrible way? Yep, one star.\n",

      "4 stars!Loved the concept, loved most of the execution—I think this debut slightly fumbled the landing. BUT that being said, the vibes and concept were enough to keep this a personal favorite.Concept: ★★★★★Plot/Pacing: ★★★Enjoyment: ★★★★Imagine this: You visit an island. Something is off about it. The people are nice, albeit your standard rural area standoffish vibe. The island itself is a beautiful piece of land off the coast of Northern Wisconsin. But there's something about these people—their clothes are dated, their cars are all rust buckets, their music is 20 years out of date. And weirdest of all... you can't find anything more tech savvy than a Walkman and a boom box. You realize the town is acting like it's 1994. And when you catch some members of the town captivated by seemingly \"live\" coverage of OJ Simpson's car chase in California—and then you catch them watching it multiple nights in a row—you realize something is seriously, seriously weird here. Because the entire town KNOWS it's not actually 1994. But they're acting out the scenario anyway. And then you find out that people sometimes disappear. Welcome to Clifford Island. You might not make it off...Dead Eleven is a horror release that I found out about randomly on Goodreads one day, and IMMEDIATELY knew that I needed to have it. From that pitch you just read, can't you see why?? What a concept. Layered into that killer concept was a mixed-media, brother/sister, and past/present timeline angle that I found too good to resist. So I bought this and read it almost immediately. Ultimately, I think this debut did a few things perfectly: the vibes, the lingering/creeping dread, the pulse-pounding \"I need to know what happened\" element  that keeps you reading late into the night. Where this book fumbled was in the ending. I think it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as spectacular as its first half implied it would be. But then... maybe it will for you. Let me know!Eagerly looking forward to more horror mixed media from this author. Blog | Instagram | Libro.fm Audiobooks\n",

Her brother has gone off to fight and she has not heard from him since he left. Her mother is battling addiction and Iris is competing for a promotion at her job against her insufferable colleague and rival Roman Kitt. Her one solace and comfort is writing letters to her brother that she has nowhere to send. But when one of her letters is magically answered by a mysterious stranger, they start to form a deep connection that will come to mean so much to both of them. Little does Iris know that the mysterious stranger is actually her acerbic Rival Roman Kitt! So many questions and mysteries lay between them and what is happening in their world.

(i’ve heard that take and i can’t bring myself to accept it, there’s a limit for how much u can leave open ended and there was A LOT in this book.) spoiler alert !!let me elaborate on this take - i saw this tiktok talking about how there were so many questions bc it’s metaphorically supposed to represent the story curse and how no one truly knows what happened, in the case of the valley arch and what happened to the valors themselves. however, i feel like it would’ve been suitable had it not been the last book in this series. this is very conflicting to rate bc on one hand i feel like the romance delivered but on the other hand it feels like the plot wasn’t completely thought out. and i did expect so much more from the romance still. jacks loved evangeline so much that he rewrote history but we still can’t get a love confession out of him?  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face end of spoilersi’m not gonna be the first to admit i love stephanie garber’s writing. i’ve been very vocal about it ever since i first read her other series ‘caraval’ earlier this year. i don’t have a problem with her writing, i think that it can be very magical and i’m glad it hasn’t changed much. one thing that has changed is the plots of her books. when i read the caraval series, the romance stayed a subplot but with this series, everyone fixates on the romance and i think stephanie garber did the same. at the end she doesn’t clear anything up and i think it might be a way to appeal to the audience bc let’s admit - a lot of ppl read fantasy for the sprinkle of romance. i had a few problems with caraval, but overall i loved it and it was very magical. i will stand by this - i love caraval for the magical world building, where the world goes more into depth and is much more magical, and i love ouabh for the romance. don’t get me wrong, the romance in caraval was almost impeccable. however the characters and their background in this series varied very differently. there was so much depth to these characters and jacks was so much more mysterious. his backstory and everything had me bawling. this is why i truly wanted a better ending for evajacks. i feel very conflicted about this book bc i love the characters so much. unfortunately there are going to be spoilers for the rest of this review. i cannot express a lot of my thoughts without mentioning spoilersthe 2 main villains in this book were aurora and apollo. and like i mentioned before, there was no clarification for the other “villains” in the previous books. i am so confused why we never find out what happens to all the other villains in the other books. marisol and tiberius had absolutely no role. she leaves it open ended in the other book about tiberius and we never find out what happens to him but apparently in this book we don’t find out either!! even luc was mentioned once but he never once appeared. it felt as if stephanie garber thought it would be good if she introduced a new villain rather than addressing the previous ones but no!! i expected tiberius to make his comeback but he was only mentioned a few times in the beginning. the fact that he was pretty much all talk no action is prominent in this book lmaoo. and marisol wasn’t even mentioned. does she just rot in jail..? either way i have hope for stephanie garber. she is still one of my favorite authors and even though i didnt like this book as much, her writing shows promise and i hope that it only improves from now. my thoughts:i’m ngl i have mixed feelings about chaos, or castor. i felt so sad after that ending with evangeline last book (like everyone else ofc) but i wonder how chaos would’ve reacted if he found out he killed eva. he seemed apologetic in the last book but he ran away (probably bc of fear). but this book he’s helping eva bc he believed jacks is going to make a huge mistake. i think chaos is overall a good person (even if he went on a whole mf blood rampage  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face ) but i don’t blame him after he was forced to wear a helm. \n",
      "And he loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her.He loved her so much he’d rewritten history. He’d given up what he had believed was his only chance at love. And now he had finally broken the spell that he never thought he’d escape.\n",
      "jacks has my whole heart. don’t u dare try and start with him not deserving a happy ending he has been through so much and he deserves the world. he’s been through so much pain, and when he talked about how he felt whenever he thought about how evangeline died i lowkey teared up  loudly_crying_face  heart_with_arrow  and when he told her oh my god i was dying. that entire scene is engraved into my brain now. HE ALSO KEPT HER NOTE ABOUT HIM CLOSE TO HIS HEART everything he does is just perfect and amazing<33 every single little detail is forever engraved in my heart. evangeline has been everything throughout this entire series. her dumb decisions kept the book entertaining i’m not even gonna lie. but also her love confession to jacks had me sobbing my eyes out it was so sweet. she has been through so much and i’m so so happy she ended up with jacks. she has been through so much and i love how she learned not to be as naive for the most part. she also learned to be more sassy and stand up for herself her character development has been everything. and her slapping apollo after she got her memories back was QUEEN SHIT  clapping_hands  clapping_hands  eva is my girl 4eva and i absolutely love her. even if she was delulu at times but who isn’t? honestly i love how she still had so much hope but didn’t feel like it was enough like omg girl  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face  i felt so bad for her. i feel like this book went completely off script. it introduced new villains (besides apollo), didn’t even clarify anything in the previous books, and the ratio of romance changed drastically. i wanted more angst, more JACKS (!!), and a much more deserved ending. i feel as though she just forgot about the other books and decided to change it up. there was so much angst in the previous books and i thought that it would build up in this book into a huge love confession of jacks part but nope. this does not mean i like jacks any less. these characters mean so much to me and i’m happy that they ended up together. there are spoilers for the caraval series mentioned in this paragraph!!the least disappointing aspect was the romance. but that’s not to say there was no disappointment bc my expectations were through the roof after tbona. there were sprinkles of it which i didn’t mind bc it’s a fantasy book, it’s not always going to focus on the romance aspects. but i still don’t understand how their relationship is gonna work with jacks being immortal and evangeline being a human. i mean dante gave up his immortality for donatella  face_holding_back_tears  i rlly expected a grand gesture from jacks, or anything. the best we got was an “i love you” and even though im happy he said it, it was the bare. fucking. minimum. and it hurts me to say that, trust me. the romance was through the roof with this series, but it drastically changed in this book. their love expanded to every universe and we couldn’t even get a love confession out of jacks? i will never get over that.the plot twist about the truth of jacks curse? i’m ngl my heart broke a little after hearing donatella never loved him which was why she survived his kiss. this is not me in any saying i ship them. but when you think about their history and how it applies then knowing the info now, it makes me feel for jacks. he dyed his hair dark blue, it was clear he was heartbroken. and to learn she never had any feelings for him made me feel a bit of nostalgia. also i have another question - does jacks ever find out the truth of his kisses and how they’re only deadly if someone who will never love him kisses him..? the ending with apollo becoming part of the tree actually made me laugh. another thing that has me laughing was how stephanie garber talked in an interview about how the tree on the cover is important in the book AND ITS LITERALLY THE TREE APOLLO GOT TRAPPED IN  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face  she rlly knows us!! i’m so glad he got what was coming to him. that scene frustrated me so much and I’M SO GLAD JACKS GAVE HIM WHAT HE DESERVED!! i waited 2 books for jacks to finally punch apollo and it happened, and i’m so satisfied with that !! and him cursing at apollo had my entertainment reaching its peak. i will say she had me in the first few chapters feeling sympathy for apollo but that quickly went away after everything happened. i’m still upset he killed the guards that only followed his command  frowning_face —the rest of this review is going to be talking about things that were mentioned/i still had questions about after the ending.would you guys believe me if i said this book was going to previously by 4.5 stars? maybe u won’t, but it’s true. during the beginning, it was rlly slow bc apollo made so many appearances and i was bored out of my mind. but every time jacks showed up it made everything better. at one point, i was contemplating on giving it 4.75 stars. can u imagine my disappointment at giving it the rating i’m giving it now? probably not but the ending was disappointing. maybe it was just me idk but it isn’t even about the apples as much. speaking of the apples, i didnt mind that as much simply bc she explicitly stated that we would know, and even addressed it which was what i wanted the entire time. if she addressed any of the plot holes, i would’ve been happy. the point of a finale is to wrap everything up and maybe if she wrote another book in this series i’d be happy but this is the end of THIS series so i don’t get why so many things were alluded. the fan theories for the apples have me squealing, i’m kinda glad she didn’t explicitly state it simply bc letting us gather our own conclusion lets us be delulu.another thing - the broken heart scar? i don’t understand why it was never used. was it just a way for eva to sense whenever jacks was nearby since it glowed? i expected more from that. i read the bonus epilogues, and it’s clear that stephanie hasn’t forgotten about it. she mentions it but doesn’t even tell us what’s gonna happen. i really expected something when it was first mentioned in the beginning while i was reading this book. i thought the mention of the scar was going to be foreshadowing but i was disappointed to find out it wasn’t. it’s basically used as a tell tale sign that jacks is nearby. something i’m curious about is how evangeline didn’t die when she kissed jacks. i think the obstacle of apollo helped show how he would meet his end eventually but also i think it helped show that there were other forms of consequences? idk i can’t wrap my head around the fact that it was so easy for them to finally kiss after not kissing for over 2 books. there’s no confirmation, just guesses evangeline has made which makes it all the more confusing. she talks about how his love might help break the curse but i wish stephanie garber confirmed at least something. i finished reading and i honest to god had to think about this book for a long time. it was so bittersweet finishing this series. but the scene where jacks had a scare and he was scared she was dying but she just forgot to breath was so cute i was laughing through my tears at that  face_holding_back_tears  pink_heart i’m disappointed lala didn’t end up punching aurora, which would’ve been fully deserved. we don’t find out anything ab lala besides the fact that she was left alone w aurora after eva left to stop jacks. and it’s clear that she wasn’t punched since she was able to leave lala and distract jacks from finding evangeline. i wonder what’s gonna happen with lala now that she’s done her part helping eva find jacks in their last quest? i feel like it was only a happy conclusion for evajacks and not anyone else who helped them along the way. also i’m so sad she didn’t get a happy ending even after meeting her true love. she truly deserves one and i hope stephanie garber does end up writing another series for her. ˏˋ°•*⁀➷once upon a broken heart - 4.5 starsthe ballad of never after - 4.5 starsa curse for true love - 3.5 stars\n",

      "I think the one word that can aptly describe this book is underwhelming. Books have no right to be this underwhelming. Especially, a highly anticipated ending book of a trilogy. The first 50% of this book was so bad that I considered dnfing and giving it a one-star rating. I admit that it got better during the last 30%. That's the only reason it's getting two stars from me.What even happens in this trilogy? I have no idea how a trilogy from such a good author, who btw wrote The Infernal Devices (TID), can go so wrong.My biggest complaint -Can Cassandra Clare stop writing so many LOVE TRIANGLES trade_mark ?? I get it. I really do. She wrote the best love triangle I've ever read about in TID about Tessa, Will and Jem. But that does not mean that she has to write one in every single book. Please stop. For the betterment of humanity please stop. The love triangle here does not even make any sense! I'm quite sure the original love triangle was supposed to be between Matthew, Lucie and Jessie. And then Clare changed her mind and we have this atrocity. James, Cordelia and Matthew love triangle is just terrible. Any other pairing would have been better than theirs. Matthew and Cordelia have no chemistry at all. Like none. Tbf, Cordelia has no chemistry with James either but that's beside the point. James and Matthew have such good chemistry. Matthew could have liked James instead of Cordelia. I mean, I think the only reason Matthew likes Cordelia is because she is unattainable. After all, she's his best friend's wife. They spent so much time lounging around in Paris while else one else suffered. They even kissed! Twice. Almost slept together in Paris. Poor James. All this happened because of a dumb misunderstanding. Matthew is James' parabatai, does he not know that James is not the cheating type? But no why does it matter? No one even tried to communicate with each other. They all are such good friends yet they never reveal their problems and choose to suffer in silence. Miscommunication makes everything so much more fun. Right?Clare is known for writing good romantic stories. But the romance in this book was terrible. Except for Thomas and Alastair. No complaints about them. They were absolutely perfect. They carried the romance in this book. Lucie and Jessie's relationship could have been so good but it was very rushed. And don't get me started on James and Cordelia. They were quite exceptionally bland. Matthew as a character had so much potential! He could have been so good. But alas it was not meant to be. James and Matthew's friendship was butchered. They spent the whole book and the series fighting about Cordelia. Jem and Will would never do this. They must be so ashamed. As I've mentioned in my review of the 2nd book, Cordelia is the blandest character ever. She is the same in this book. Also, she has become so whiny. She kept complaining about everything. Why do Lucie and Cordelia become parabatai? They barely know each other and spent the whole book fighting. I'll admit that Alastair grew a lot on me. I hated him in the previous books. But his character development and his romance with Thomas were done very well. The villains were extremely one-dimensional and stupid. The action in the last half was very predictable.  Except for Christohper's death. That surprised me. I think Matthew was supposed to die in this book. There were so many hints that he would die. I read in an interview that this book was supposed to have a tragic ending. But Clare changed it due to the pandemic situation. Matthew dying would have made more sense than Christopher. But I'm glad. Despite his faults, I still like Matthew a lot. One funny thing is that no one except Thomas really seemed to be affected by Christoper's death. He is supposed to be their childhood best friend but since everyone got their happy ending, they seem to have forgotten him. This book might not be as terrible as the previous book, but it was still a terrible mess. Pre-release thoughts-I hope that James gets a happy ending. He deserves better.  Cordelia and Matthew did him a grave injustice. Why would they run away to Paris without even communicating with James? Matthew is James' Parabatai, is he not? How could he run away with James' wife? This was a sharp contrast compared to the bond between Will and Jem. Matthew is not a good Parabatai.Part of me still thinks Matthew loves James, not Cordelia. I mean Matthew and Cordelia's chemistry is quite literally non-existent. James and Matthew have a lot of chemistry in comparison to them. It will make a lot more sense if Matthew loves James since he has always wanted a hopeless love.  I also want Matthew to get a happy ending but tbh, I don't he will get one. I hope this is not tedious and stupid like the previous book. Please don't be a soap opera.\n",

      "i firmly believe that the last hours will go down in history as cc’s best shadowhunter series (yeah i said what i said) and these characters will remain some of her most iconic.cordelia and alastair carstairs will specifically live in my heart for years to come. every moment they spoke in farsi, every reference to persian poetry, and every instance of tenderness between them hit me right in the chest. their individual development and their sibling bond was some of cc’s best character writing i’ve seen yet. also, if jordelia doesn’t rank within your top three shadowhunter ships then idk what to tell you, you’re just wrong.this book wasn’t without its flaws and hiccups. there were times when scenes would be cut off too quickly and i wish that certain plots had been resolved earlier than they had. however, my emotional investment in these characters and my unwavering desire to see them get their deserved happiness won out. and all in all, this ending was so much happier than i thought it would be and i’m very grateful for that. i want to LIVE in that epilogue and i pray that cassie continues to churn out short stories featuring these kiddos because i refuse to accept that this is the final goodbye. i’m really going to miss my family.\n",

      "➷ powerless follows paedyn, a cunning and sassy street thief from the slums trying to make ends meet with her best friend. this is set in a world that went through a great plague — the majority of people who survived (the elites) were graciously gifted powers to them by the plague and those who didn’t (the ordinaries) were banished or killed. in pae’s kingdom, ordinaries are inferior to elites, and the king ordered for all ordinaries to be eliminated to preserve his elite society. paedyn is an ordinary who pretends to be an elite and poses as a psychic so that her true identity is not exposed. but when paedyn saves prince kai she finds herself thrown into the purging trials, a deadly competition held to showcase the elites’ powers — the one thing paedyn lacks.i know this book is heavily compared to Red Queen and The Hunger Games, but as i haven’t read neither of those books i can’t make any comments on that. — there is no better feeling than when a book is so good you simply can’t put it down and you end up staying up late reading it. this book had my attention gripped, especially the last 100 pages!! 1 more page turned into me finishing the whole book at 2am. i needed a fun, light, banter filled romantasy to help with my slump and this is exactly what this book delivered, both of the main characters had me in the biggest chokehold. yes this book was very tropey but it didn’t ruin my reading experience as the author cleverly wove in the tropes into this story without it feeling like she was shoving them down your throat. she did also mention that she wanted all of her favourite tropes incorporated into this book. \n",

      "➳ paedyn: right off the bat i absolutely loved pae, her sharp tongue and her even sharper mind - i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!! ➳ kai: the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!! — what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!!  loudly_crying_face ➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate  face_exhaling  the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!! \n",

      "— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect. this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!\n",

      "I'm going to be that person and give this a not so 'lovely' review.The two stars straight of the bat is someone who wants a Mummy (Rick / Evelyn) romance, well, it's there. It's a POC character, and there is so much historical importance / information about Egypt. I wanted to like this book, but the way the entire romance and focus on how Whit / Inez is written is so confusing and honestly, it's poor. Poor woman's Rick & Evelyn. Inez is a bit of a problematic female. Girl is chasing after an engaged man and getting upset that he is not perusing her. She would not drop her feelings and they were so superficial. She hardly has known him for a week and already professing her love for him and says that they're 'friends'. Are they? Are they really friends? Sounds more like an obsession. The tone of the book is thrown out the window by this ridiculous lusting Inez has over Whit and how she is constantly angry with him about not returning any feelings.Whit was problematic too. Throughout he book, he was written as if someone was a bit TOO high on 'cocky male vibe drugs'. I can't tell you how many times Whit 'lounged against walls' 'crossed his legs while lounging against the wall' 'drank from his flask' 'crossed his arms across his chest'. This absolutely got on my last nerves, and I felt like the author was trying to push home this dude was sexy. CAN WE FIND OTHER WAYS TO EXPRESS HIS SEXINESS INSTEAD OF THIS CLICHE STUFF REPEATED? Together, they absolutely brought the book down. Their 'will they / are they / won't they' was a mess. There is also the magic aspect. Nobody in the world seems to care about this magic aspect people gleam / get from looking at artifacts. Do many people know of it? If this was a thing you'd think society would be a lot different than how it is. I don't understand the point behind it and why it exists and why it only existed in the past. I know it has been lost for years, but the schematics / magic lore was laughable and honestly, if you removed it from the book you would probably get to the same point just taking longer. This book is a downright mess and if it makes it to print I'd have to side eye it a bit for roping people in based on the Mummy comparison. Trust me, Evelyn / Rick's romance is written a million times better with their banter and slow burn chemistry.\n",

      "2 ✰ Great concept, poor execution.Inez is a 19 year old girl from Argentina who's parents are archeologists and spend 6 months of the year in Egypt. For some reason, they forbid her to come live with them, so she is stuck in Argentina until news of her parents's mysterious death reach her. She heads over to Cairo, where she meets her uncle (now guardian) and his assistant Whit who are both very secretive about the events surrounding her parents' death. Sounds interesting, right?Things I liked: eight-spoked_asterisk  The portrayal and criticism of British colonialism in Egypt eight-spoked_asterisk  The second half of the book where there's some action and things, you know, actually happen.... that's it.Things I did not like: eight-spoked_asterisk  Any of the characters. Inez is an annoying girl-child who gets offended for being called 'sheltered', when that is exactly what she is. Inez's parents are cold-hearted weirdos for letting their daughter be raised by her aunt on another continent for no apparent good reason.  (although we do find out that Inez's mother is a lying, cheating slug of a woman later on, so I guess that provides some explanation) Whit, the love interest is a self-centred, lying flirt who is in a state of semi-drunk stupor for most of the novel. We get a rushed reveal of his *tragic* back story at 95% of the book which is supposed to show us how noble he is, and make us forget that he flirted with Inez whilst being engaged the entire time. Because isn't that sexy? eight-spoked_asterisk  The magic system. 'What magic system?', I hear you ask. Exactly. Ibañez basically used magic to aid the plot where it needed it, and ignored it the rest of the time. There's magic, but apparently no one cares in the book. Nor do we get an explanation why magic sticks more to some people but not others. It just does, because it's convenient. eight-spoked_asterisk  The miscommunication / lack of communication. All of Inez's stubborn stunts could have been avoided if her uncle or Whit actually bothered to tell her the truth. They kept information from her for no apparent good reason. There's not really much mystery around her parents's deaths except for her uncle choosing to withhold information. Why? Because let's face it, if he'd told her earlier there'd be no real plot. eight-spoked_asterisk  The pacing of this book was just a mess. The first 50% nothing happens and Inez asks the same questions to Whit/her uncle and they give her the same answers. She makes some futile attempts to look for clues. Whit flirts with Inez. That's it. But there's so much action packed into the last 30-25% of the book that all the twists come one after the other. But we have no build up to these, no clues dropped - the author builds no tension leading up to these events, making the twists fall flat. Then there's a cliffhanger ending (which would have been amazing, had I not lost all of my will to read on after book one). All in all, this book could have easily been a standalone had Ibañez cut down the \"Whit is so annoying/Whit is so bawny\" infatuation phase that predominated the first half of the novel.  eight-spoked_asterisk  And that brings us to the love story, which was, for a better word, just ugh. Whit has no adorning qualities which would make a sane, normal woman fall for him except the fact he is good-looking with a sharp jawline and muscles (p.s the overuse of the word 'bawny' to describe him every 5 minutes made me gag). So let's just call this for what it is - a bit of lust. He saves Inez's life once, I'll give him that. But the rest of her reasons for 'being in love' are pretty weak: \"But he had saved my life. Cared to make sure I was comfortable. Took my side in arguments with my uncle.\" Ok, wow, I mean girl those are some pretty low standards. You're allowing this dude to lie to you and treat you like dirt because sometimes he remembers to make sure you're 'comfortable'? Is the reader supposed to be impressed by this list? Anyway, I was not impressed by most of this book. Again, it's one of those ARCs I would have DNF'd earlier on if it wasn't an ARC. I just felt compelled to keep reading to provide a well rounded review.I received the ARC on NetGalley in exchange for an honest review------------------------------------------Ugh, this was such a mess of a book.

      "For the Illumicrate September read-along.\n",
      "Ava Reid wrote the same book again: pretty white girl suffers. No one understands her yet she's so relatable. She’s weak and pathetic until she has sex with a pretty white man, and then suddenly everything is fine. This is very feminist you see because she never touches an icky sword. Or has any type of meaningful relationship with another woman. Female empowerment!\n",
      "This turned out to be another one of Reid’s superficial yet superfluous attempts at tackling complex subjects, complete with a tacky coating of “pop-feminism” and a forced romance arc. Don’t get me started on the clunky writing and ridiculous similes that pepper this book: if I tried to list them all here, I would be quoting the entire book. Some of my \"favorite\" passages are:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The edges were curling in on themselves -either shyly or protectively, as if the parchment had a secret to hide.\"“She stared down, instead, at the bleeding ink on the back of her hand. The words were starting to blur, as if the address were a spell, one with a tauntingly short life span.”\"She pried open her purse and dug for the small glass bottle, uncapped it and poured out a single pill. It was the rosy color of an unopened flower bud, dead before it would ever bloom.”\"His eyes were the color of sea glass, a matte and cloudy green.\"“His shoulder was pressed against her chest, their faces close enough that Effy could see the muscle feathering in his jaw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is this pitched as Dark Academia? Because they’re both college students? Because it's a popular genre? I don’t think I even understand what “Dark Academia” is anymore—but my friend jokes that is when PhDs engage in knife fights with each other over who’s getting that sweet grant money. I’ll take that over whatever this trend has become. Why is this pitched as Gothic? Because that’s what’s popular right now too. The Crimson Peak is gothic (deliciously so), this is just a sad imitation of the aesthetic. Why is this pitched as (academic) rivals to lovers? They aren't even studying the same subject. This is a one-sided rivalry where Effy hates the guy because he’s from another country and is constantly trying to put him down because how dare he, a dirty Argantian, be interested in a Llyrian national author; meanwhile, Preston is nothing but polite and apologetic towards her. That said, I don’t mind if she has this flaw—it makes her feel less vapid, a bit more real—but I wish it was actually addressed in the narrative and contributed something to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "“You want be the first to tell his life story,” she said. “You’re—you’re just the academic equivalent of a carpetbagger.” An Argantian trying to write the narrative of a Llyrian icon’s life—of Myrddin’s life—it was so aberrant that she was at a loss for further words. “No one owns the right to tell a story,” he said flatly. “Besides, I’m not pushing any particular agenda. I’m just here for the truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m convinced no one truly wants to write the actual trope, they really just wanna ride the coattails of its popularity. In this upside-down world, apparently, Natural Philosophy hasn’t been “invented” yet, and Literary analysis (NOT Philosophy) seems to be the most prestigious thing one can study, while architecture is seen as the lower-status field. It’s honestly utter nonsense if one looks at history, but Reid hand-waves it as something that has to do with the magic in this world. It’s also obvious Reid did not research architecture or technical drawing. Even someone like me who took only a semester of Technical Drawing in High School (I wanted to go into chemical engineering before deciding I liked biochemistry more) realizes she has no idea what an architect actually does or the tools they use. The narrative makes it sound like Effy is always just sketching or doodling as if she’s taking art classes: there’s no mention of trigonometry, geometry, or algebra, not even in passing. I know these days all you need to do to get glowing GR reviews is write a \"relatable\" character and a half-baked romance. Still, every time someone praises Reid or similar writers for writing \"non-average\" heroines/protagonists I want to introduce them to genres outside of YA/Fantasy/Romance. The truth is your universe is small, and you're pretending somehow her books are refreshing and revolutionary because you don't know anything else. The books you're looking for exist, and they're actually well-written. Some of them are even considered feminist classics. \n",
      "The word “girlboss” has done irreparable damage in understanding the nuances of female characters & any female character that dares to show anger, isn’t some martyr, and wants revenge is being dismissed as a “girlboss”\n",
      "I honestly think Reid took the criticisms of her first protagonist to heart (\"Évike is too mean! She's too violent! She doesn't cower enough as a survivor should!\") and tried to over-correct: bought into the idea that the solution to this was writing now two books about the same \"fragile white woman\" whose problems get magically solved by the love of a man who happens to be \"Not like those other evil men\" (not groundbreaking stuff but, to be fair, still preferable over those abusive love interests that permeate YA and Romance). Évike wasn't multifaceted, and her romance didn't have depth, she was angry and, most of the time made some pretty dumb decisions but she actually had a spark of personality buried deep down. Effy, on the other hand, is a blank slate, and only seems to have a backbone and a voice when goading or being xenophobic towards Preston, the only male character in this world who is not a misogynist; when she's not screaming at her love interest, Effy's constantly blushing, on the verge of crying or whining, playing her “fragile white female” part. There's zero chemistry between Effy and Preston outside of some forced banter, quoting perfectly book passages from memory and pseudo-intellectual discussions. Their relationship comes across as juvenile infatuation. I also firmly believe Reid is writing her self-insert/trying to tell her story, but at this point, she should stick to an autobiography. As someone who is a survivor and has \"drowned\" in depression all of her life, I'm willing to call her out on how depression manifests in many forms, not just crying and \"feeling numb\" (while Effy does show anger at times, it is only directed at Preston); and it's certainly not healed by having sex with a pretty white boy. Sex that, while consensual, is still called a \"tender assault\", in yet another pointless simile that only makes the scene come across as creepy, instead of \"empowering\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A combination of the Whispering Dark and Divine Rivals mixed with some Barbie movie America Ferrera speech messaging about sexism (imo for 5 year olds but yymv bc some girlies loved that)\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is not about \"Female empowerment\".If you're claiming your book is a Very Important Work and an honest exploration of mental illness, women existing in a misogynistic world and women reclaiming their voice at least be actually nuanced about it; if you touch on female empowerment as a writer then actually commit to it. Don't spit on my face and tell me it's raining.No, I did NOT find Effy relatable at all. I found her insipid. I just hope Reid doesn't come at me for writing a 1-star review.\n",

      "The main aspect of this novel that blew me away was the writing. It was stunning! Normally when you encounter beautiful writing it's in writing that's shackled to emotions, to larger-than-life characters and their overpowering feelings, and although the writing in this book is always emotive and Zhao still shines in the heartfelt moments, it's the descriptions of settings that enamour you. You are transported into this world and it is impossible to look back, you hear every melody of the wind, you catch every glimpse of moonlight through the trees. Every sight, every sound is within your grasp, effortlessly written. It is such a skill to be able to enchant a reader like Zhao does.The world is rich and frothing with history. Worldbuilding is always something I admire and you can tell that the author knows every depth and crevasse of her world. Legends and mythologies are wound into the fabric of it, into every story that is told, into words unspoken and forbidden, into books that are left to rot and cultures that are forgotten throughout time. We unravel the history of this world as we are swallowed by it, unlocking new pathways we never dreamed of walking. It is so complex and masterfully woven, sharing glimpses into the secrets of the past with sharp precision at the exact moments the reader needs the information revealed to them.The characters are also spell-binding. They, too, have histories inside them, legacies and unknowns and ghosts that haunt them. They are complicated and fragile, they are determined and strong. They want to fight for their world, a world they do not know how to save. They want to fight against their enemies, enemies they do not know how to conquer.\n",
      "So long as there was life, there was hope.\n",

There were lots of twists and turns in the story, punctuated by meaningful commentary on society. I loved the way we got aspects of Greek mythology as well as inclusions of mythology in other cultures, such a Egyptian deities. Characters: Io was a particularly interesting character to follow as we got to see a lot of her inner struggles with guilt and self-confidence. The casual inclusion of several side characters that were queer was also really well done.

Our mc Io is a descendant of the Fates, meaning she can see threads- the shimmering lines that connect people. Threads appear when a relationship is formed and a person's life thread is cut when it is their time to die. One night, Io is witness to a violent murder and must work with Edei Rhuna in order to solve the case and uncover Alante's secrets. But what is even more complicated is that Io can see a fate-thread connecting her to Edei- meaning Edei is her destiny.

Once Io started to unravel (ba-dum-cha) the various mysteries, I was on the edge of my seat.I’ve never read a book with characters who could manipulate the threads of Fate. It made for some interesting storylines like *ahem* the fated-thread between her and Edei.

      "Summary of review: Save yourself. I lost four precious hours of sleep for this book. I will never get those hours back.I'm going to start a petition to leave bully love interests, \"not like other girls\" female MCs, and plot holes more prominent than the freaking Grand Canyon in 2012.What even was this book? I was promised a lush middle eastern inspired fantasy, a badass female main character out to save her brother, and a journey that was supposed to be filled with adventures. I was promised magic TEA. Instead, I got a headache and an intense urge to bang my head against the wall to dislodge the memory of reading this disaster of a novel. My therapist will be hearing about this.The plot. I ask you, what plot? Imani's brother has been missing for a year. Instead of processing her trauma, she throws herself into her work as a Shield, a band of sorcerers. When Imani finds out that her brother might be alive, she is sent on a mission to retrieve him from the outside world, and in the process makes friends and they betray each other and yada yada.Imani left a very bitter taste in my mouth. Right off the bat, we are told she is known as the Djiin slayer. She is supposed to be one of the best in her ranks. Yet, we only see her fight once. We do not see her training or any support for her claim of being \"the best.\" She blindly believed everything that she was told. That was fine at the beginning because she did not have a reason to question anything her authorities said. But as the book went on, she kept going “but that can’t be true! Why would the authorities lie to us??” It has been so long since I have read such an incompetent female. Our two love interests. I have absolutely nothing nice to say about either, but one was clearly more horrible. Taha was absolutely horrendous. My enemies have treated me with more kindness than that boy seems to possess. He is quiet, moody, and a bully, but since he has trauma it’s okay! Imani, against all the odds, develops feelings for him (cue fake shock.) He literally does nothing but belittles her, and when he does show kindness, it is when no one else is around. The moment someone else is around he goes back to being as an asshole. He treats her like she is gum on his shoe, and she still gets a crush? Make it make sense. (Slight spoiler, but also TW for SA.) There is one part where Imani sees a man trying to sexually assault a woman, who is powerless to stop it. Lovely Taha decides it would be “too risky” to try to help her. Thankfully, Imani has a centimeter of a spine and helped her. I feel like that said a lot more about Taha’s character than anything else. If he is not willing to give a woman basic respect when it is hard or inconvenient, I do not want to know how he would treat someone he is actually dating.Qayn was fine. He was barely in there, so I do not really have an opinion of him. He pops ups every once in a while, to deliver a “hilarious” one-liner (spoiler: he was not funny) and make Imani blush. Whenever Taha messed up, he would make an entrance too, to be tantalizing or something. At the very least, he seems to have some respect, so he is slightly better than Taha for now. He also has a trauma filled past to make him more appealing. I would still rather eat a whole lemon than ever read a word about him again, but I digress.Every other character was annoying. They were there for one personality trait and then faded back into the distance. My favorite characters in the whole story were the freaking horses. I do not even LIKE horses very much. What has this world come to?I am out of steam. If I spend one more second thinking about this book, I will lose my last shred of sanity. Save yourself, and don’t read it. Unless 2010 books are your favorite. You might love this one then. (Not a diss at people who like those novels. I am being genuine. Just not my cup of tea.)---------i have eaten charred and bitter toast that left a better aftertaste in my mouth than those characters. a not so nice rtc\n",

      "Quick thoughts: Wow. Absolutely fucking brilliant.\"For every child of color who was denied the justice they deserved. You always matter.\"With a dedication like this, I just knew that this book was going to rip me apart, and it absolutely did. This is a story that follows the Dupart family, a Black magical family in NOLA that has been torn apart thanks to racism, betrayal, and deceit. 30 years later, twins Clement and Cristina are determined to uncover the truth behind their grandmother’s death while hoping to bring their family back together. I can’t even begin to describe all of the emotions that I went through while reading this book. I absolutely loved Clem and Cris even when they were making the dumbest of decisions. I couldn’t help but root for these Black babies to keep them protected at all costs. I LOVED the magic system and the magical communities. We see magic of the Black ancestors that of course the white folks are trying to get their hands on and even the underpinnings that take place within the Black magical community itself. The Dupart family is MESSY, but I was here for it. I think I secretly just wanted to drink some bourbon alongside Ursula while she was cussing folks out. Honestly, this family is just top notch. There were so wild twists in this book that made me set the book down and just go “WTF just happened”. I was hooked. I don’t want to give anything away, but this one is definitely a roller coaster ride. Thank you TorTeen for providing a review copy. This did not influence my review. All opinions are my own.\n",

      "*3.5Blood Debts is a gripping and magical story set in New Orleans, filled with mystery, political intrigue, and several characters, each with their own motivations. The premise of Blood Debts was exquisite, and while I thought the execution could use some work, overall, I think it's a great story, with great potential for the sequel. Before we get into the plot of the story, I want to discuss the audiobook! Because this story followed several POVs, each one was narrated by a different person. These narrators all did a great job of embodying each character, in my opinion. I also liked that there were different narrators for the characters. This helped me keep track of whose point of view we were in, since all of their voices were so distinct.As for the story itself, I thought the characters were all really well-rounded, and I could always understand where their motivations came from. Some of the characters could be unlikeable at times, but I think this was intentional. Since they're teenagers, it makes sense that they're messy and imperfect. It made the story feel much more genuine. In regard to the plot, I loved the idea of a magical New Orleans. It's the perfect setting for a story like this, so I couldn't wait to read it. And overall, I thought it was done really well. The magic system itself was intricately designed and thoroughly developed. My main issue with Blood Debts came from all of the plot points. There were so many of them that I had trouble keeping track of what was happening and how each event was connected. I feel the book would have been significantly strengthened had it focused more on fewer main plotlines and worked to thoroughly expand on those. Then, the rest could be explored in the sequel. Despite this, though, I did still enjoy the premise of Blood Debts, and I'm interested to see where it's going in the sequel, so I'll definitely be continuing on with the series!Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with both a Digital ARC and an Audio ARC in exchange for my honest opinion.\n",

      "I'm an Alexandra Bracken fan and have been for ages, but SILVER IN THE BONE is certainly one of my favorite books she's ever written! From the get go, I was caught in the current of her storytelling for Silver in the Bone. The potent combination of Arthurian legend and Celtic lore, a quest/journey with unexpected allies and a plot that (mostly) kept me on my toes \n",

I also quite enjoyed getting to know the cast of characters, and particularly liked following Tamsin (even though she definitely had her frustrating moments) and watching her story unfold until the very end of this book (with more to come in the sequel). All in all, this is yet another stellar story from Bracken, and I'm in dire need of the second book after reaching the very last page!\n",

C’est une réécriture intéressante des légendes Arthuriennes, j’ai trouvé que c’était parfois un peu brouillon genre on mélangeait pas mal de choses (légendes arrhuriennes, sorcières, monde moderne et légendes urbaines) mais ça fait un univers vraiment original. Je pense que j’étais pas tout à fait dans le mood donc j’ai mis plus de temps que je ne le pensais à accrocher, mais c’était malgré tout une lecture intéressante et CETTE FIN ?? Le suspens de malade wesh, ça se fait pas…Sinon j’ai beaucoup aimé Emrys et Tamsin que j’ai trouvé très intéressants. Voilà.\n",

      "— bone  3.5 stars  bone —“Do you not know it by sight? You have found the blessed isle of Avalon.”————about the book————Age: YAGenres: Fantasy, Mythology, Retellings, Urban fantasy, Writing: 8/10Quotes: 7/10World building: 7/10Characters: 7/10 Romance: 6/10 My rating: 7/10 ———my thoughts———Tamsin Lark didn’t ask to be a hollower.As a human with no magic, she never thought she’d be breaking into crypts and fighting sorceresses.But it’s the only way to keep her brother (Cabell) safe and alive.10 years later, Tamsin hears rumours of an ancient Arthurian ring that could free Cabell of the curse that threatens his life.But as word spreads, more and more people begin to take interest...and while Emrys Dye is the last person Tamsin wants to work with, she needs all the help she can get.I grew up reading Arthurian legends.Not because that was what I was made to read, or because that was the books we had, because I loved them.The green man, Morgan Le Fay, Guinevere, and Arthur himself.I read all the adaptations I could get my hands on.So I was excited for this book.It sounded perfect!But the book and I got off on the wrong foot.When I got jumpscared by the word “sneakers”.I thought this was a high fantasy, NOT an urban fantasy...But apparently not.I also found the world quite hard to be enveloped in...I was looking for that completely immersed feeling, and I didn’t get it.I think that’s probably my fault though, because the amount of times I got distracted in the first hundred pages is in the triple digits.But as soon as they got to Avalon, everything got better.We had the magic I’d been looking for, we had the creepy-but-beautiful setting, we had a problem to solve, instead of just bumbling around.The middle part of the book was definitely my favourite, and I had hopes that it would continue that way!But no...I just couldn’t get into it.The characters also made it hard to get through...I didn’t like them for a large portion of the book.Tamsin (while having the best name) wasn’t particularly endearing. I liked her pessimistic attitude, but her overprotective tendencies got old quickly.Also, Emrys felt like he had so much more depth than was shown, and that annoyed me.Their relationship didn’t feel like it built at all, and just jumped from “i tolerate you” to “oh goodness we’re hiding together in a very small space AHHHH touching”I just feel like a lot of things weren’t explored or explained enough.The ending was one only thing that really made me gasp in surprise the whole way though, and I am intrigued by it...so I guess the cliffhanger did it’s cliffhanger-y thing of making me want to come back...I will be reading Lore at some point soon, so I can truly figure out if it’s Alexandra Bracken’s writing I don’t like—or just this particular book.————quotes————“I can at least be brave enough to tell you. I can tell you that to me, you’ve always felt like spring. Like possibility. I admire you, and respect you, and I want to be near you as long as I can. As long as you’ll let me be.”“Let the dead die, Tamsy. It's only memory that truly pains us, and they release it when they go.” ———random extra thoughts———I didn’t even mention how annoying Cabell is...oh well.Thanks for reading!  red_heart \n",

      "If I could sum up my thoughts on House of Marionne, it’s this:  sparkles confusion sparkles . This book, mining from enduring YA tropes and conventions, had so much potential that could have been focused into some thoughtful genre innovation, but alas, it just felt confused about what it should be. A Bridgerton-esque romantic social drama? A Game of Thrones-style political fight? A classic girl-has-magic-must-save-the-world YA fantasy in the vein of Shadow and Bone? An atmospheric fantasy reminiscent of Stephanie Garber’s books? With the sheer amount of marketing, hype, and comps thrown out there about this book, I expected it to deliver on at least one aspect, and somehow it fell flat with all of them.The beginning started off strong, with just the right amount of accessible worldbuilding and mystery to keep me intrigued as the main character, Quell, fell into the magical, polite societal world of the Order. J.Elle handled the urban fantasy genre well, blending modern-day with an interesting undercurrent of magic. But once Quell arrived at her grandmother’s chateau/magic school, it all fell downhill. The magic school felt oddly like Hogwarts, the explanations for the sociocultural structure of the Order were flimsy at best, and the characters were all bland. All aspects had thematic potential but were glossed over in favor of stuffing as many familiar/marketable elements in as possible. In particular, I wish the implications of the debut culture were explored more, either as a way of reclaiming power or commenting on the exclusive and discriminatory nature of such traditions. Unfortunately, every element of the book, from plot to characters to atmosphere, suffers from the inability to commit to an idea or trope. It lurched indecisively between romance, magic school, politcking, and self-discovery, and couldn’t even decide if it wanted to be plot-driven (stakes arising from magic) or character-driven (stakes arising from Quell’s need to belong). Quell herself was a cookie-cutter protagonist that I couldn’t bring myself to invest in because she felt like an amalgamation of every other popular YA FMC. I mean, even her name kind of evokes “not-like-other-girls” (it’s short for Raquell and pronounced “kel” but that’s only revealed at 50% so I spent the entire book calling her “quell,” verb-style). Her evolving romantic relationship with Jordan (MMC) is limited to physical proximity until halfway through they start spending time together because the book is marketed as having a swoony romance; their love confessions felt unearned and for the sake of delivering on the pitch. The side characters were all forgettable because they only served to help Quell and had no clear motivations of their own. And just when I thought House was going to commit to a pure character-driven plot, a big bad villain pops up with little foreshadowing.Another thing that really bothered me was what an absolute slog it was to get through this. I knew at about 15% that I would have DNF’d if not for it being an ARC, so I planned on speed-reading the rest. I’m normally a pretty good speed-reader, but this one just dragged. It’s nearly 100 pages too long and full of dialogue that should have been cut, including entire transition scenes that could be handled in a few sentences. The dialogue almost reminded me of a transcription–it was as if Elle was merely transcribing the characters speaking, which resulted in pointless dialogue that did nothing but boost the word count. The pacing was also really slow, though the last 25% picks up and is definitely the strongest part of this book. And lastly, the writing skewed younger YA or upper middle grade, which felt like a strange choice given the somewhat more mature and nuanced talk about privilege and nepotism in the last 25%.Ultimately, this book wasn’t for me and I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re in the mood for a familiar hodge-podge of YA tropes. I can see why this book is getting marketed so heavily as it contains every up-market, high-concept YA element that sells good enough to get on the NYT bestseller list. Unfortunately, in an ever-competitive YA fantasy field that demands new takes or refreshing spins on familiar elements, House of Marionne reads more like a teen Netflix series: all vibes and little substance.2/5 starsThank you to NetGalley and Razorbill (Penguin Young Readers) for the e-ARC!

      "I am honestly not sure what I read, haha. I probably should have ended up DNFing but I wanted to see what I would be missing if I did. Unfortunately it didn’t get better for me.The book is told from two point-of-views. One comes from Quell Marionne and she is the daughter of a Headmistress in some magical order. I wouldn’t say I ever connected with her or her story. She felt immature for her age and I wasn’t sure why she would make certain decisions. The other point-of-view, which is the first one, pulls you into the story but doesn’t give you much to go on after. Everything moves so quickly with little-to-no context.I wish there would have been more about the world-building and the magic. I didn’t understand a lot when it came to both of these and still don’t get it after finishing the book. The book is on the longer side and so there was definitely room for better explanations. On that note though, I feel like the book could have been shortened as well. There were some lulls and some parts of the plot that didn’t really add to the story overall.Overall, it was okay. I just don’t have much to say about this one. I didn’t connect with it in any way and because of that I have already forgot a lot of what happened.Thank you to the publisher and netgalley for a complimentary earc to review!

      "I went into this book expecting a sophisticated story of intrigue during a season of society events. The cover and descriptions lead me to make those expectations. What I found was a boarding school like setting with a poorly described magic system and simple writing that made me think this is more middle grade than YA. The opening chapter is set in New Orleans and had me thinking I inadvertently picked up an urban fantasy book. We’re quickly transported to a fantasy location. The main character is going to hide from an assassin at her grandmother’s castle, where she’ll have lessons in magic and comportment in preparation for being presented a Cotillion. The world isn’t always described clearly, perhaps because the story is told in present tense by the main character. She’s simultaneously observant of certain things while completely clueless about others. For example, she can see someone who is using magic to be invisible, but then she can’t figure out how to hold a teacup while having tea with her grandmother. Her roommate grew up in this world and has been at the castle for two seasons trying to pass three tests. Our main character, who didn’t grow up in magical society, is able to pass two of the three tests in days. She is completely untrained, but is also a Mary Sue with the best powers. As a reader, I was constantly pulled out of the story by wondering why something was happening or by writing that was trying hard to be dramatic without artful prose. The sentence “I searched his eyes for knowing” is seared into my brain. A chandelier is called a candelabra (it’s said to be hanging from the ceiling). “A hushed gasp sweeps” through a room during a ceremony that has happened many times, but we aren’t told what’s different about this time. A hallway “halts” instead of ends. The ending exists. Kind of. The premise is interesting. I think that a young reader might enjoy this book. Perhaps if the publisher positioned this as middle grade, I’d have a different experience with it, but it doesn’t stand with other YA fantasy books I’ve read. It’s not the kind of writing I find engaging and I think the world building needs work. It was unsatisfying and a bit of a chore to finish this one.\n",

      "Was this my most anticipated read of the year?  Heck yes.   Was I disappointed?  Extremely. Before I start this review I just want to make it clear I love this series and characters so much. I still recommend the first three books in the series. They are so worth investing your time in. This one? Not so much. It started off really well. The four brothers together, talking and bonding. I was really entertained for the first 60-70 pages and then it went downhill. The  pacing is slow. Firstly let me start by saying  Nash and Xander  are really vital and core members of this series and the lack of them makes an immense impact. Nash and Xander both provide a sense of unity, balance, family and peace into Grayson and Jameson's chaos. I missed the two so much in this one. It was a terrible mistake on JLB's part to kick the two out of the book. Secondly, the  dynamic between Grayson, Avery and Jameson  completely fell. The three act like they no longer know each other. There are so few scenes of the three together it's just strange. Grayson and Jameson deserved more scenes together. They are no longer rivals stuck in a love triangle. Coming to the  \"love aspect\".  Those who haven't read the series yet, might want to skip past these few sentences.   Jameson and Avery were so amazing in the last book together. They had such good growth and Jameson was shining. Here, they had zero chemistry. Sure, they had like two good scenes together but the rest of the book they act like they are strangers? It is so weird. Grayson and Avery still have better chemistry. It hurts to see my man is still hung up on her. There clearly lies more in store for  Grayson.  His story is not complete and this was the sole reason for this book. But while doing so, am not sure what JLB was trying to achieve. He is broken. Hung up over so many girls who betrayed him so many times. He stood up to Eve towards the end and opened up to his brothers but his character needs more. There was no healing for him. Hopefully that gets rectified in the next book.  A major problem was the fact that JLB wrote the story in a very confusing manner.  We get Grayson and Jameson's POV. Both have missions of their own. Jameson's mission in particular served no major purpose. His character deserves better than that. Apart from two different missions, we get flashbacks in between which just makes things worse. The back and forth along with different pov started to make things unnecessarily complicated. No doubt JLB is a talented writer but she made a lot of mistakes in this. The way  this book has not much to offer and is written in such a boring manner makes it comes across as written purely for the purpose of money grab.  This book easily could have been a novella, 200 pages short but it dragged on in a miserable way. It surely reads like a novella but is a proper book. The only reason I will read the next book is for the fact am not ready to give up on Grayson yet. ~•~•~LET'S GOOOO. Justice for my bae~.~.~Justice for Grayson Hawthorne or I sue.\n",

      "★ 3 starsi was almost sure that i’d give this book one star because the first half of it was horrendously boring.i mean, it started off well and had the potential to be as good as the previous books, but when i reached the 15% mark, the story just... became unbearable. and it was so hard to follow since we had two different and unconnected storylines — Jameson’s and Grayson’s. Jameson’s chapters were the ones in which i was more interested since he’s one of my favorite characters. his storyline sounded promising at the beginning, and i obviously thought that i would love it — but sadly, i ended up losing a little bit of interest after a few pages. don’t get me wrong, i still adore his character and he remains one of my favorites, but his story was very confusing. there was so much information to memorize that at some point i just gave up on trying to understand what was happening and started skimming through some pages. so i’s partially my fault that i didn’t understand much of it. the only thing in his POV that kept me interested from beginning to end was his scenes with Avery, i absolutely loved them.\n",

      "their stories were both well-written, but they weren’t as captivating as i thought they would be. and as i said, they were hard to follow. if you asked me to explain the entire plot of this book, i seriously wouldn’t know what to say. i think the idea of having two different — and complex — storylines in just one book wasn’t great. it would probably be better if they were linked in some way.we got some flashbacks from when they were kids and we were able to see a little bit of how was their relationship with their grandfather, Tobias. but even after finishing the book, i still don’t understand what was the point of that. just to show us how insane he was with his sick mind games? i really don’t get it. in my opinion, most of those flashbacks were irrelevant. another thing that didn’t like was the fact that we didn’t have much scenes with Xander and Nash, and that doesn’t make sense at all since this book is called The Brothers Hawthorne. i was aware that the main focus was going to be Grayson and Jameson — but their brothers definitely deserved more spotlight. i saw that JLB is going to release Grayson’s book (was it really necessary though?) next year, so she might as well write Xander’s and Nash’s books too. i would love to read their stories.surprisingly, i started to enjoy this book in the last 40% — that explains why i’m giving it three stars. a few entertaining things happened and the plot twist near the end was awesome. the epilogue was enjoyable too, but i think it could’ve been more exciting. for some reason, i felt like something was missing.even though i liked the second half, i’m still extremely disappointed. i was expecting a far more interesting story, but it just fell flat to me. i guess i set my expectations way too high. well... at least it didn’t give me a reading slump so for that i’m grateful.will i read the next book? of course.do i want Xander’s and Nash’s books? yes, obviously.but deep down, i think it might be time to wrap this series up because it’s getting repetitive. maybe it should’ve stopped at book three.───────── ⋆☆⋆ ─────────my ranking of the TIG series:1 • The Inheritance Games | ★ 5 stars2 • The Hawthorne Legacy | ★ 4 stars3 • The Final Gambit | ★ 3.5 stars4 • The Brothers Hawthorne | ★ 3 stars\n",

      "What a ride. I was fully invested, if I had more time on my hands it would've been the perfect book to binge read in a day. Once one gets into it, there's no putting it down. You would want to theorize, to find out what really unfolded, the motives and who is the betrayer. I saw a lot of reviews stating that the start is slow, that wasn't the case for me. From the first page to the last page, it was of a  consistent pace.  I did not struggle at all getting into the story. The  plot twists  were absolutely amazing, and unpredictable. I loved how it continued to surprise me right up till the end. The complexities came with the  characters-  1. Red-  Such a complex character, there's depth to her. I liked how consistent she was with herself, but I would have liked her more had she been a bit more outspoken instead of a pushover.  2. Simon-  Honestly, he was the best of them. The humor he brought to the story was so easy to like. He was balanced, never overdoing anything and keeps the reader sane.  3. Arthur-  I went from like to dislike then to feeling bad for him. His morally grey character is a bit disturbing but his chemistry with Red is worth exploring.  4. Reyna-  Yeah no. Wasn't a fan. She's forgettable. Her sob story had no effect on me, I don't like cheaters. 5. Maddy-  She was there too. Pretty dumb tbh and she annoyed me at times.  6. Oliver-  Oof, he's the most complex characters of all in my opinion. I hated him. But at the same time I appreciated how the author wrote him. Let me explain, you think you know someone all your life but things happen, life threatening ones, and the person you knew is no longer there and instead an absolute stranger and a selfish guy is in front of you. I liked how real and truly disturbing Oliver was. He is the typical Mr Know It All guy who can't do shit. Anyway, what am saying is that it's his crap that made other characters interesting and brought more life to the book as a whole. Tho, I hope I never meet someone like him in reality  eyes  grinning_face_with_sweat I wish the sniper could've been a little more attention but it's all good, the story was quite entertaining and the twists and turns make up for it.This was my first Holly Jackson book and it did not disappoint. I cannot wait to check out A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, just have to pick it up from my shelf... someday  face_with_tears_of_joy  So glad my cycle of bad reads is broken.

      "talia hibbert is truly a genius and Brad Graeme might be my favorite character of the yearThis book was a genuine delight from start to finish. I could not stop giggling and smiling down at my kindle as I got to know our two protagonists, Brad and Celine. For a short synopsis, this YA romcom is about two former best friends who drifted into different social circles at the start of their high school career and now are full blown academic rivals who \"hate\" each other. As academic rivals do, they both enter a wilderness survival competition which could land them an amazing scholarship opportunity. Through this competition they reconnect, sparks fly and yadda yadda ya typical romance stuff. Where this book excels is the character work and the incredibly witty dialogue. As previously mentioned Brad Graeme may be one of my favorite fictional boys of the year. He's a bisexual, athlete with OCD and big dreams of being a writer some day. Quite genuinely his inner monologue is the funniest thing I have ever read, he's entirely overdramatic and ridiculous while simultaneously being incredibly sweet, earnest and deeply emotionally intelligent. This isn't to say that Celine is less funny, or adorable because she is absolutely all of those things! She's the grumpy to Brad's sunshine, in the best possible way. I loved her emotional journey to figure out who she truly is and what she truly wants rather than allowing herself to be defined by the abandonment she experienced as a child. Something that Talia always does exceptionally well in my opinion is establishing her characters fears and flaws in a way that lays the groundwork for the emotional conflicts that tend to arise in the latter half of most romance books, and so her stories have an emotional depth and sense of clarity to them that I think many romances lack when it comes to the typical third act break up structure most traditional publishers tend to favor. Anyways I'm a bit off track but Celine and Brad complimented one another in the most beautiful way, and I feel that the friendship aspect of their friends-to enemies-to lovers tale was done with exceptional deftness. The love that bloomed between them was truly heartwarming to read about and I absolutely recommend it.\n",

      "What I loved most was how the story was told from four characters' perspectives, and how the changes in voice kept the varied plotlines moving, each touching on an aspect of the life of wealthy Black families during the turn of the century in Chicago. Each female character and/or their love interest was portrayed in a way that showed how the expectations of one's family, status, and expectations could impact everything from how they dress, to who they're seen fit to wed, to what positions they're able to take in their work and love lives. Anyone who loves a bit of historical fiction will find this a charming, smart title with plenty of drama and real-life issues and plenty of romance and the social events we've come to expect from this time period to keep it interesting. For me, it was the perfect balance of history and storytelling and was a unique viewpoint that I hadn't read before. Looking forward to continuing the series and seeing more from Marquis in the future!Thank you to Penguin Teen for the advance copy to read and review, follow me @booksaremagictoo for more book reviews & recommendations!\n",

      "I fear this was the worst book out of all 4! A couple things REALLY bothered me:- Daphne’s “pregnancy”: You are telling me that the entire royal family, their staff included, would let Daphne and Jeff get engaged BEFORE they confirm she’s pregnant at all?!- Nina being the anonymous email sender: I think everyone was OOC in this book but this was really out of left field. I really do not believe Nina would have blackmailed Daphne and Ethan!! Her explanation was a cop out and very odd.- Daphne’s scheming: I am BAFFLED that there was ZERO resolution in terms of Jeff finding out about Daphne’s manipulation of him. Am I supposed to believe that he never finds out about any of her lies, ESPECIALLY the fake pregnancy, and on top of all that, she actually gets some redemption at the end?!?! I also hated that Himari barely got any justice so I guess we really are just letting the main villain in this series get off scot free!!!!The previous books in this series were not the best but still entertaining, while this book was a nosedive into the dumpster. As I mentioned previously, I found pretty much every character to have some weird OOC moments. Jeff coming into his own as the heir but essentially being a total idiot emotionally is another one that stands out to me. For my own sanity, I won’t even get into the amnesia plot line!This book did not really meet my expectations, but the sad part is the bar was not that high. I was subconsciously motivated to return to this series because of all the Red, White, and Royal Blue content I have been consuming, but I think I will go back to that for any of my American royal family needs and attempt to forget this mess!\n",

      "In a Nutshell: I can see why the YA audience will go gaga over this. I can also see why some adults will love this. But mine, yet again, is an outlier review. Sigh. Story Synopsis:Seventeen-year-old Avery is moving with her parents from Washington to Bardell, Georgia, in order to take care of her terminally ill maternal grandmother, Mama Letty. She isn’t happy about the sudden move, especially when her mother doesn’t even have a good relationship with Letty. Moreover, there is some past secret that they refuse to talk about. As Avery settles into her new school and makes new friends, more secrets come tumbling out, and Avery is left wondering if resolving past issues is more important than maintaining present relationships. The book comes to us in the first person perspective of Avery.Where the book worked for me: smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  Such a gorgeous cover! And it fits the book perfectly! smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  There are some third-person interludes throughout the book depicting incidents from the past and concerning other characters. These are written well and add a nice balance to Avery’s first-person perspective. smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  There are some interesting themes such as dysfunctional families, the value of friendships, and acceptance of sexual identity. The dark past of the American South is blended well with contemporary reality. Avery’s mixed race background also adds some nuances to the story (though this particular factor could have been handled much better.) smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  As an OwnVoices work, it’s no surprise to see that the book is inclusive in its representation. There are many LGBTQ+ characters who are out and proud of it. There are also some closet queers whose emotions over coming out are written well. But… (continued below)Where the book could have worked better for me: unamused_face  (continued from above)… but some of the representation exists just for the sake of it. For instance, Avery is supposedly pansexual, yet throughout the book, her feelings are more lesbian than pansexual. The rep felt like it was included because it was a cool thing to declare.  unamused_face  If I have to describe the plot at its simplest, it is just about a bunch of women (of varied ages) who come together and bitch about the other women in their lives, either to their faces or behind their backs, and who consider themselves right and everyone else wrong. Basically, each one of them thinks that they ‘deserve a monument’. This gets tiresome after a while. I didn’t like a single main character in this book as all were self-absorbed. unamused_face  I can stand only *so* much of whiny, judgemental, egocentric teens who consider themselves smarter than all the adults in their lives. Imagine a seventeen-year-old being out of the house all evening (without permission while being grounded), not returning till 5am, and yet arguing with her mother for overreacting about the incident that was ‘not a big deal’. As an adult, it’s irritating to read about such teenagers! unamused_face  Almost all of the contemporary white characters are villainous. The only one who isn’t, has a minimal stock role to play. This makes the writing somewhat predictable. Moreover, there are too many disparaging comments, and some really odd accusations that are tough to digest. I don’t want to go into spoilers, so I will give a similar but unrelated example. Would you point fingers at Hitler’s relatives who are alive today, for what he did during WWII? The drama was much over the top.  unamused_face  There is a supposed mystery in the book, but it was much half-baked and not even worth the time.  unamused_face  There is a sapphic romance in the book but I wasn’t a fan of the way it was written. Typical teen love, full of physical attraction and hardly any other connect. unamused_face  I am not a fan of YA books that have the main characters indulging in drugs (weed) and alcohol (whisky) without guilt. I also don’t appreciate the presence of risqué scenes or cuss words in this genre. The audiobook experience:The audiobook, clocking at 10 hrs 22 min, is narrated by an experienced narrator whose works I have enjoyed in the past. Not this time though. While I was initially impressed with her attempt to voice characters distinctly, it soon became irritating. Her dramatization was exaggerated and her stress on individual voices for the characters ended up making them sound caricatured. The audio version will work for those who don’t mind hyperbolic performances. Some YA books work for all age groups. Some work only for their target age range. To me, this fell in the second category (though the GR rating and friends’ reviews prove me very wrong!) Basically, I can see the appeal of this book to the YA crowd. But I was the wrong audience for it, not because I am not a YA, but because it was too YA for me. (I should have gotten a clue from that very self-absorbed title.) I go in mentally prepared for a lot of anatomical references and shallow characters in YA reads, but the prep didn’t help this time. At the same time, I am very much an outlier on this. So feel free to ignore my opinion and give it a go. It’s by a debut author, and they would certainly appreciate your support. 2 stars. My thanks to Recorded Books and NetGalley for the ALC of “We Deserve Monuments”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the audiobook.———————————————Connect with me through:\n",

      " I was just browsing Barnes & Noble one day, spending all of my gift cards and money because it was the after Christmas sale which is my favorite time of year, and I randomly stumbled upon this book, said \"Oh, this cover is cute, and hey, it reminds me of Taylor Swift!\" and then bought it. I'd vaguely heard of it before and it sounded really fun, which it was! The book was pretty cute and sweet, but of course, it had its flaws. The PlotThis was basically the bachelor in the perspective of two contestants, who just so happen to fall in love with each other instead of the scumbag guy.I typically hate miscommunication in any book, not even just romance, but honestly I loved how in this one it added more drama. It didn't last for too long, but it made for a good, short rivalry.I also liked reading through the different challenges because I love competitions in books no matter the genre, and I also enjoyed watching Skye and Maya conjure up their revenge plan against Jordy as they slowly began to trust each other and work together.Though I must say, I wish the girls had actually believed Maya faster when she said all those bad things about Jordy, but they all decided to trust Jordy over anything, though they could've let Maya actually speak instead of shutting her out and telling her that she was jealous of Skye.The CharactersSo now, here's one of my biggest issues. None of the characters really stood out much to me, but when they did, I deeply disliked them. There was never a moment I was like \"oh my gosh yes, I LOVE this character\" but there were moments where I was like \"oh my gosh no, I HATE this character\" which is not something I want to feel when reading a book, since characters make or break a book for me.Maya and Skye both were going back and forth on my \"do I like them or not\" scale. Sometimes I liked Maya more than Skye, sometimes I liked Skye more than Maya, but it usually bubbled down to what was happening in the moment. Skye was really annoying sometimes, especially when Maya did that one thing at the end and she really shouldn't have gotten that upset because she should've trusted that Maya knew what she was doing, she knew how much Maya hated Jordy, so there's no way she would do that. And then there were the times where Maya annoyed me to no end, like when she was rude to the other contestants and completely irrational towards Skye.I'm not even going to talk about Jordy because he's a disgusting, slimy person who doesn't deserve a section.I actually quite enjoyed the side characters too, though some of them I didn't really like until the end after they stopped fawning over Jordy. I love Isaac though, so much. He's the only character I really loved.The RelationshipsNow here's my second issue. I love rivals/enemies to lovers and quite liked when Skye and Maya were rivals, like their banter was funny and cute, but then when they became \"friends,\" they switched into lovers way too fast for my taste. Like they'd been friends for a little bit (unless there was a time jump and I missed it..?) and then suddenly one of them wanted to kiss the other. Nevertheless, the romance between Maya and Skye was really sweet and adorable.I really liked the friendships between the girls in this one too, like they all had their own personalities and some of them complemented each other really well.Overall, I quite enjoyed this despite some of the flaws I found in it, and it was a nice, cute, fun read to pass the time!3.5 stars\n",

      "This was such a fun read!! It's one of my later ARCs (Dec 2022) but it was calling my name so I dove in 6 months early!  grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes  Our MCs, Skye and Maya, have something in common: they both previously dated a-hole-womanizer Jordy... unbeknownst to them, he dated them at the same time!!  face_with_rolling_eyes Two years later, they're invited to participate in a Bachelor-style reality dating show specifically tailored to Jordy and his exes. It's a \"second- chance-at-romance\" show, aimed to rekindle a romance between Jordy and one of the women from his past. After being forced to bunk together on the show, Skye and Maya find out they have two more things in common: They're both bisexual, and they're both developing feelings for someone on the show... someone who is NOT Jordy.  eyes I adored this book! If I had to give a criticism, it would be that Skye and Maya didn't have distinct enough voices for the first half. I kept mixing them up. They 'sounded' (in my head) like the same person.  woman_shrugging  No distinct mannerisms or tones to set them apart. In the last half of the book I began to see their differences a bit more and their individual voices became more apparent.  two_hearts Even so, I give this a solid 4/5 stars because it was cute as heck!!! This was my first Sophie Gonzales and it definitely didn't disappoint! I am excited to read \"Perfect on Paper\" next!  raising_hands Thank you NetGalley, Sophie Gonzales, St. Martin's Press & Wednesday Books for my eARC in exchange for my honest review.  two_hearts \n",

      " This book is fake dating done best, because both Eliza and Caz have valid, and believable reasons to get into the fake dating arrangement - and the stakes are equally high for both of them. Now, I know you'd think that a relationship between an idol and his 'normal' classmate might read like a self-insert fanfic - but the book will surprise you with how real and grounded it feels. Ann Liang has done a noteworthy job of not writing it not like a teenage girl's unrealistic dream, but a legitimate possibility. This story spoke to me in so many ways, but most potently through the fmc, Eliza. In simple words, Eliza is me and I am her. But then again, I don't have an idol boyfriend, or a grand following online so what do I know  smiling_face_with_tear “I guess my point is that I do believe in love. Really. I'm just not convinced that kind of love could ever happen to me.”“Sometimes I'm convinced I'll spend the rest of my life this way. Alone. Sometimes I think loneliness is my default setting.\"Eliza Lin is stubborn, pragmatic, mistrusting, guarded, and a control freak. She is an expert at fading into the background and is a cynical romantic at heart. Thanks to her mother's job, she has had to move to different places all over the world, numerous times. She keeps her heart guarded and meticulously plans everything down to a T so that she can save herself from any possible hurt. As I said before, we're both the same. If you didn't know me, now you do  kissing_face  “He’d flirt with a teaspoon if the situation called for it.”Caz Song is a rising superstar in the Chinese entertainment industry. He's charming, popular, friendly, witty, funny, charismatic, and vain in the way that actors always in some ways are - but what gives depth to his character is his unexpected vulnerabilities and his unwillingness to let someone see past his easy-going facade. “When you care about someone, you want to be inconvenienced—you wouldn’t mind being inconvenienced by them every day for the rest of your life. That’s what love is. That’s all love really is.”Throughout the story, pragmatism gives way to soul-searching and thus starts a beautiful teenage romance where we see both of them slowly learn to trust each other, grow together as individuals, and tackle their own problems and shortcomings. I enjoyed their banter and loved seeing how they slowly got comfortable with each other despite the initial awkwardness. I laughed with them, I cried with them, I screamed at them, and I wanted to protect them from the world. Their growth as a couple and individuals had me invested from the start. Their chemistry training sessions were also a delight to read, especially because we also saw Eliza rediscover the homeland she left years ago, and find her footing. “Romantic breakups are romanticized constantly, talked about everywhere by everyone, but platonic breakups are swept to the side, suffered in secret, as if they’re somehow less important.”Eliza is also struggling with maintaining a long-distance friendship and this story does a marvelous job of showing how sometimes due to circumstances people drift apart, how friendships fall apart, and how deeply experiencing that hurts. It takes mutual effort from both parties to keep any friendship going. To stand the test of time all friendships need trust and communication - showing and telling the person what you're feeling instead of making the worst assumptions and accepting the loss before it has happened. Having lost multiple friendships over the course of the last few years, this aspect of the story resonated deeply with me. I cried seeing how Eliza finally learned to let people have her back, and to let people in albeit slowly.“I do like him,” Emily says slowly. “But if he was mean to you, I’ll stop liking him immediately. I won’t even invite him to my next birthday party.”I also loved the relationship between Eliza and Emily. Being an older sister myself, I felt Eliza's protectiveness over Emily. Their interactions at school reminded me of times when my sister and I went to the same school. I care for my sister the same way Eliza cares for Emily. Honestly, having a younger sister is the greatest joy ever - she's a right shit most of the time, a pain in the ass, and you might want to smack her into the next century for all her sarcastic quips and the trouble she gets you into but when it's important, you can trust her to be in your corner - always. if you quote me on this though, i'll vehemently deny ever saying this  kitchen_knife AND I CANNOT SAY THIS ENOUGH, Eliza's  clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone  parents  clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone  are  clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone  everything clapping_hands_medium-light_skin_tone This book also gets major bonus points for two The Untamed mentions, and Caz's shampoo smelling like green apples (they always remind me of draco lol).Personally, since I felt the ending was super rushed, I'm going to go make a presentation for Ann Liang titled - Please Consider Writing a Mutually Beneficial Sequel to TTIR, I am Not Beyond Begging.massive bear hugs to Deema, and Lyra - because of you lovelies i found a book that cured my b13 ya trauma, i can't thank y'all enough  growing_heart  growing_heart \n",

      "“What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?”\n",
      " — Mary OliverClover Brooks lost both her parents in a tragic accident when she was just six-years-old. Now 36, she lives in the West Village apartment that her beloved grandfather bequeathed to her. Despite the roughly two million people in Manhattan, all living within an area of just 23 square miles, Clover’s only true friends are her three rescue pets and her 87-year-old neighbor. Clover mostly chooses to hole up inside her apartment and binge-watch movies to numb her feelings of loneliness and isolation. Given how death has shaped her own life from such a young age, Clover wants \"to observe it, to decode it…to find sense in the thing that feels so senseless.”She actually works as a death doula, firmly believing that everyone deserves to die with dignity and with their wishes carried out. Clover provides companionship and end-of-life support.She records her clients’ final words in one of three private notebooks — Regrets, Advice, or Confessions — that she then revisits regularly.From the Advice notebook, she’ll randomly pick an entry and try to live by that guidance for the next week. Sometimes, it might be as simple as treating herself to a bunch of fresh flowers from the corner bodega (advice from Bruce, the plumber with a passion for gardenias).With the Confessions notebook, Clover tries to do something that might make up for a deed a client had confessed to. In the case of Ronald, who prior to his death admitted to stealing money from street musicians when they weren’t looking, Clover always carries around ten-dollar bills so she can quietly slip them into musicians hats and instrument cases whenever she sees one.Choosing a Regret, Clover tries to find a way to honor it, believing that if she can learn from it — and avoid making the same mistake in her own life — then it wasn’t in vain. To honor 80-year-old Lily, who never pursued her passion for painting because her ninth-grade teacher told her she had no talent, Clover signs up for an abstract painting class. Despite the underlying theme of death, The Collected Regrets of Clover by Miki Brammer is in no way a macabre tale. Clover is such an endearing character and there are life-affirming gems scattered liberally throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed Brammer’s debut novel and since life is short, you only get this one, and there is no dress rehearsal, I highly recommend you give it a read. Tell me, if today were your last day on earth, which of Clover’s three notebooks — Advice, Regrets, or Confessions — do you think you would end up in…and why?\n",

      "I was highly skeptical about this one because the description was just too sketchy. However, I’m glad I went ahead and still read it because I ended up having my heart pierced just the way I liked it. There were a variety of personalities when it came to the characters, keeping the book really interesting. The imperfections of people were laid bare here, which was reasonably necessary for the theme of forgiveness that was clear throughout the story. Touchy subjects like these can be quite tricky, and so I commend Harris for doing a great job with this! I loved how it ended, and this is one of the few times I wish a book had a sequel!\n",

      "I almost DNFd this book at 30%, but made an effort to see it through. Awkward writing, unconvincing plot points (such as the main character falling in love with the identical twin brother of the man who raped her), and strange character elements (like the main character's father only speaking in lines of poetry) made this a frustrating read.\n",

      "Oh my god! Amazing and brilliant! Brave and compelling! And that ending  collision  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~When I turned the final page, I sat and tried to absorb the feelings and emotions from this impactful and powerful story. Harris has taken a story that needed to be told and ripped my heart to shreds.Fair warning – you need to be open and willing to read about the aftermath of a sexual assault. Trust me when I say, I was nervous too, but this author takes a tragedy and creates a miracle. It is truly a stunning story.Harris has taken the raw and gritty and gifted us with heart, compassion, healing, forgiveness, and love. Set aside a quiet weekend and read this with tissues and an open mind. One Summer in Savannah and Harris is amazing and brilliant! Brave and compelling! And that ending is nothing short of bomb-tastic!This is the best read of 2023 so far!

      "Butts: A Backstory is an interesting and occasionally educational book, but it really doesn't deliver as advertised. The history of the human buttocks is a curious and complicated subject for a book, embracing the topics of evolution, culture/sociology, and sexuality. Radke makes clear from the start that she is going to refine her subject as the female butt and strictly the butt, rather than a further inclusive exploration of the anus. Fair enough, but this is still an enormous subject, and precious little of the subject matter makes its way into the pages, much to my frustration and disappointment as I read.The blurb for Butts: A Backstory talks about the duality of Butts as cultural symbols, from objects of sexual desire to points of derision and humor, and in the forward to the book, Radke elaborates on this concept, talking about the various expressions in English that embrace butts, from \"working your butt off\" to \"falling on your ass\" to being a \"butthead,\" or \"buttface,\" etc. From this intro, I figured the book would really delve widely into an exploration of the cultural dimensions of attitudes about buttocks. I was curious to hear how foreign languages and cultures (ie. non-American and non-English) interact with butts, and how they have done so throughout history. I was especially curious to see what Radke would have to say about Asia. I reckoned that humor and derision associated with butts would have broad implications, embracing cultural characters like Assy McGee, Ace Ventura, and Beavis and Butthead, and I was curious to hear what Radke would make of the odd waxing and waning of butt humor through the years and across cultures, with fart jokes being popular in 18th century Europe, for example.Alas, Butts: A Backstory isn't a broad exploration of butts on any kind of historic or multicultural scale at all. Instead, Radke sets out to put her own anxieties and discomfort about what she describes as her own large butt into personal historical context by exclusively focusing on attitudes and culture surrounding women in Britain and the United States from the late 19th century to the present. This focus isn't entirely consistent, as there is some discussion of gay men and a bit of divergent material about evolutionary biology, but more or less, this book is an Anglo-focused exploration that centers on cultural hangups and appropriation of African Americans by white Americans. This is an interesting and important and valuable topic for exploration, but the history that Radke traces, from the exploitation of Sarah Baartman to Victorian Era bustles, to flappers to Marilyn Monroe, to Buns of Steel and Aerobics, to Jay Lo and twerking, isn't really a backstory of butts at all. It is the history of mass culture in America and Britain with respect to female bodies and associated hangups. It also is very far from an exhaustive exploration of same. For example, Radke never talks about nudity in films and the odd distinctions between showing breasts and showing buttocks, and the strange practice of butt doubles.So... Butts: A Backstory feels like an odd book to review. The jacket summary and the writer's forward promise an exploration of a subject that the book doesn't explore. The subject omitted is a rich and complicated and interesting one. The subject that the book does explore is also interesting, but it isn't really about butts at all, as Radke actually tacitly points at the end of the book, where she admits that she could have been writing about almost any part of the female body. There is a lot of grist in the subject of butts—how and why American culture can simultaneously be obsessed with them and extremely uptight about them, laugh about them and mock them and slaver over them, etc. But, how does this strange duality compare with other cultures and with other cultures throughout history? Moreover, the weird cultural fixation on different racial types of butts... is there actually anything to it genetically? Are Asian hips and glutes actually any different from European ones?I generally try to rate books based on what they strive to be rather than on what I might most prefer a book to be, but I think this book was badly mispackaged and misleadingly sold. The cover tries to be cute and lascivious. The author's forward promises an exploration of a subject that the subsequent pages entirely abandon. The book that does result is interesting, but quite narrow, and it misses and avoids most of what I was curious to read about. My feeling is that it's somewhere between 2 and 3 stars for quality of research and writing, but my general aggravation at being misled drops a star. Meh. I'd say that this is a decent read if you're interested in the actual subject, which is about white Anglo obsession with perceptions of black women's sexuality, but don't read this book if you are curious to learn about the sociology of buttocks.\n",

      "My Recommendation  This was an incredible true story about the most prolific and brazen art thief in history. Between 1995 and 2001, Stephane Breitiviser is said to have stolen 239 valuable/priceless works of art from 172 museums, cathedrals and castles all over Europe. The author, Michael Finkel, extensively and meticulously researched his life, psychological theories about his mental and emotional state, personality, enablers, police investigations, and court cases. Many involved in the case, including Stephane himself, were interviewed.  Stephane considered himself superior to other art thieves as he never stole for profit. He felt the art was better cared for 'under his ownership' than in museums. While viewing specific works of art, he was overcome by aesthetic adoration and an obsession to have the treasure for himself to revel in its beauty. He was assisted by his long-time girlfriend, Anna-Katherine Kleinklaus, who frequently accompanied him and served as a lookout when he committed a burglary. He carefully removed desired objects using merely a Swiss Army knife, and the robberies were committed in daylight hours. Art objects he brazenly stole included paintings, sculptures, antique weapons, dishes, and decorative containers. He wanted to feel the joy of owning the object and the thrill of acquiring it.  He hoarded all the stolen works of art in two rooms in his mother's attic, where he lived with Anna-Katherine. All available spaces were decorated with his ill-gained treasures. He deluded himself into thinking that his mother thought he was carrying in cheap art acquired at flea markets while his mother denied seeing anything. Items estimated at between one and two billion dollars were displayed for the couple's pleasure. He was arrested, eventually confessed, and showed an encyclopedic memory of everything he stole and where he acquired all the items. He was sentenced to three years in prison and served twenty-nine months. (2015). During the trial, Anna-Katherine expressed a strong dislike for him and denied helping him.  Stephane's mother, his estranged father, and grandparents were strangely tolerant of his crimes. He had been spoiled, enabled, indulged, and felt entitled. His mother provided him and his girlfriend with living space in her home and later apartments, groceries, several cars and even gas money. After Anna-Katherine abandoned him, his mother found him a new girlfriend, Stephanie, and he moved into her apartment. He lived off Stephanie, his mother, and government assistance.  In 2009, he had the impulse to shoplift designer clothes and then a valuable painting estimated worth $50 million. Much to his surprise, Stephanie kicked him out of her apartment and notified the police. While he was in prison again, his enraged mother threw all the gold, silver, and ivory artwork into the Rhine. They are recovered from the mud, restored, and returned for display. Sadly, all the paintings and wood carvings were believed to be burned in the forest, a shocking and tragic loss of culture and art.  In 2016, badly in need of money, he went against all his stated principles, went on a robbery spree, and sold his accumulated valuables on eBay and other internet sites. Almost 200,000 dollars he had gained was recovered, and he was sentenced to prison again in 2019. This fast-paced, gripping story is highly recommended for art lovers and true crime readers. Thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Random House Canada (Knopf Canada) for this compelling book. Publication is set for June 27.\n",

      "This book is based on what the ancient Vedic texts call the four ashrams. The way Shetty has used and described the four ashrams is completely incorrect and his own interpretation. This entirely construes the sanctity of the four ashrams. I understand it may be adapted, but to show that the ashrams are all based on ‘love’ is wrong. The single star rating I have given is for the author’s ability to link back to the Bhagavad Gita and bring in examples from Shri Krishna and Arjun. I wanted to avoid this negative review, but felt that I must be honest with what I had read and thought.\n",

      "I’m not usually a fan of self-help books, especially on love and relationship which is such a subjective experience, unique for every person. But I must say – I found Jay Shetty’s second book really helpful, and I liked it even better than the first one. First off, my absolute favorite chapter was the one on solitude and finding your own self. It was super enlightening and Jay, if you can hear me, you should do a book just on that – finding and understanding your true self. The 2nd chapter, about karma, was also insightful. But even the tasks and ideas on how to solve a conflict with a partner and show affection was really interesting and useful. Like a guide for level-headed adults on building a partnership with honesty.I have 40-odd yellow post-it notes marking so many quotes throughout the book, so that should sum up how I feel about this book.So why not 5 stars? Some parts went on too long and the ending on loving everyone was a bit utopian for me.\n",

      "Sejujurnya, ketika liat judul buku barunya Jay Shetty yang ini, aku teringat lagunya JKT48  face_with_tears_of_joy  (Aturan Anti Cinta)...But anyway, aku bukan mau bahas korelasi lagunya JKT48 dg buku ini ya. Aku malah pengin share what key takeaways yg bikin aku menyadari sesuatu dalam hubungan kami.Dalam 8RoL, Shetty menekankan kalau beda antara \"mencintai\" dg \"memiliki\" tuh tipis banget. Seringkali kita memaknai \"cinta\" sinonim dg \"ownership.\" Padahal setiap manusia punya otoritas atas dirinya sendiri. Every one of us punya kuasa buat nentuin mau dibawa hubungannya (you sing, you lose).Kalau dilihat di medsos, you may see aku & Syemmi semacam happy-go-lucky. Di baliknya, ya ada perbedaan argumen. Intonasi suara yg meninggi & omelan. This book, reminds me again to have a healthy discussion. I can not control him & he is my possession.That's one thing. The other thing yg aku syukuri adalah: Syemmi ngasih aku banyak \"gift\" yg selama ini aku dapatkan dari orangtuaku.Aku ngeh banget gimana usahaku buat nggak mengulangi pola yg sama dg kekurangan orangtuaku (makanya aku baca buku kayak gini..). Tapi rupanya tanpa sadar aku juga punya standar yg nggak aku cantumin dalam ceklisku. Misalnya nih, karena dibesarkan dg ayah yg hobi ke museum & toko buku, aku jadi nyari partner yg juga bakal enjoy kalau ku ajak ke sana. I want to feel that kind of excitement dg orang yg kusayang & yg sayang dgku.Aku sempat menertawai kisah cintaku yg terdahulu gegara bagian 5 Types We Fall For. Been there done that & jadi belajar banyak hal soal benerin diri & mindset. Akhirnya aku paham, standarku buat nyari partner nggak bisa pake standar society atau akun menfess di Twitter  face_with_tears_of_joy  Nggak bisa pake standar \"nyari partner supaya bisa dipamerin di depan mantan\"  rolling_on_the_floor_laughing What I love about this book adalah 2 bab awal ngebahas habis tentang self-love. Bukan yg normatif. Tapi ngingetin kita kalau \"lu mau pasangan yg kayak gitu, ya lu kudu usaha sampe ke level itu.\" No one lift us up kecuali diri kita sendiri.Such a good book to see \"love as a verb.\"\n",

      "The best book on health, aging and longevity I’ve read, by far the most up-to-date and comprehensive. I love the idea of Medical Science 3.0, where the focus is preventive care instead of treating the disease, and health-span instead of lifespan, and treating a patient as a whole instead of the problematic parts. The book covers many health related topics, such as cardiovascular diseases, dementia, metabolic system and obesity. It also covers sleep and emotional health, topics often not included in a generic health book. It confirmed two of my views: 1. sleep is very, very important and it affects everything; 2. Your mental state affects your physical state. I totally agree with the author–what's the meaning of living longer if you are so unhappy? Some interesting new discoveries (to me): 1. Is Alzheimer’s disease a metabolic disease? 2. Is there no link between dietary cholesterol and cholesterol level in blood? 3.To treat cancer through metabolic intervention? Diet that reduces insulin and IGF-1 may aid breast cancer treatment? If he can only give you one piece of health advice, that is you need to exercise. Large portion of the book is about why and how to exercise. I am convinced that not only cardio is necessary, but also muscle strength and stability training. The author also convinced me that nutrition science has a long way to go and our current nutrition research is deeply flawed. For this reason, I’ve downgraded How Not to Die: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Diseasefrom 5 to 3. Highly recommended.Some resources:https://peterattiamd.com/outlive/videos/Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS):www.rehabps.comPostural restoration institute:www.posturalrestoration.com\n",

      "This collection of 10 essays weaves together memories and experiences of the author's real life with the rich and varied lives of sea creatures, from octopi, Chinese sturgeon, whales, sand strikers and immortal jellyfish to yeti crabs and more. My favorite part was learning about some deep sea creatures I had never heard of before, the kinds of beings that live in oases around thermal vents on the ocean floor and survive by chemo-synthesis. I loved a story about encountering a bloom of clear, gelatinous creatures known as salps flooding the water of Riis Beach, a historically queer hangout spot in New York. This book wrestles with heavy content- one essay deals with eating disorders and parental pressure to diet, another with sexual assault and blackout drinking. It's hard for me to judge the quality of these essays when my life has not been touched by these topics, but I appreciated the author's honesty and the thoughtful maritime metaphors.\n",

      "3.5 starsIn the Western world, almost all our technological devices use rechargeable batteries, and with the push to move to more electronic vehicles, there are more and more rechargeables needed. A good amount of cobalt goes into each of those batteries, and the Congo is where you’ll find the majority of cobalt to be mined. Unfortunately the bulk of the people who do that mining are “artisanal” miners – they are mining on their own, so to speak; they are not employed by any company. They are extremely poor and have no other options to make money. Their kids could go to school, but even though it’s supposed to be free, it is not funded well-enough for that to be the case and they need to pay. Most families cannot afford to pay, so their kids also have to go to work mining. There are no health or safety standards and when people die or are injured not only is no one held accountable, no one is there to help pay medical bills. What they are paid for the cobalt they mine (putting their lives at risk) is next to nothing.The author travels to mines and through villages in the Congo, talking to the people mining. He tries to talk to some of the companies paying for the cobalt (and some of the middlemen), but there are only a few who will talk to him. This was interesting and so very sad. I didn’t rate it higher, though, as I did lose interest occasionally. That might have been due to other things on my mind, I’m not sure.\n",

      "Bettina Love pulls no punches about America's educational system as a carcereal institution where private companies are making fortunes off of punishing black bodies. Tracing the failure of especially urban education fr9m Reagan's \"reforms\" through No Child Left Behind, Dr. Love vivisects public education to lay bare a decline that many have been decrying for decades. As one of those white teachers in black schools who also teaches at the college level and who has taught in majority white spaced none of this was news to me. She gets a lot right. We need more black teachers. We need equal opportunity, equal resources, and equally difficult content. I'm even firmly behind reparations. If you arent, you especially need to read the last chapter. Show it to your racist family. Love also does amazing and important work drawing explicit connections between the War on Drugs and education reform. But there is a core issue here that still has not been addressed. Money per student is spent very differently in minority majority institutions than white schools. Dr. Love goes into the what of that, and calls for change. She puts the why completely on white supremacy, racism, and anti-blackness. But is that all? What is really going on on the ground here? Why can't some schools retain substitutes, paraeducators, nurses, counselors, all those support staff to spend money on instead of resource officers? Why does the school I work in have half of their students not receiving instruction in core subjects because of lack of personnel? Why did multiple teachers and every single paraeducator leave within the first month? Why are the vast majority of school staff (black and white) on the job market every single year for a job in one of those white spaces? Why would children rather be in ISS than regular classes?Money isnt the only issue here. What kind of education do we want for everyone? What is its purpose? How do we get there? How do we get people to be curious? The industrial jobs from before the period of Love's study aren't coming back. Education has tanked across the board, although to varying degrees. The anti-CRT movement that Love discusses is worse than many realize and fights against basic things people our age and older take for granted as true and should be taught in school. What about the implosion of higher education? Minting too many PhDs? What needs to change in education to help people stay in the field. And just so much more. Overall, this really resonated with me, but I wanted more connections and more acknowledgement of the multilayered complexity. Dr. Love and I are of an age (I entered high school in the 1993-1994 school year) making many of the personal experiences quite resonant. I'm here to keep listening and do the best that I can.\n",

A word I personally feel is too frequently and too casual offered as a descriptor but incredibly fitting here, talking about him. ⁣⁣David Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL. He completed additional armed forces training and has completed numerous! ultra distance races. David now works as an ER EMT and during summers, as a wildfire firefighter. David has accomplished a lot! However, his path was anything but smooth and he’s faced countless challenges along the way, beginning back in childhood. ⁣⁣Never Finished is about mental grit, becoming dedicated to discipline, and giving your all, to all things you commit to. ⁣⁣Never Finished is David’s second book. I loved his first book, Can’t Hurt Me, and highly recommend both. The audiobooks are read by Adam Skolnick, followed by conversations with David after each chapter. At first, I wasn’t sure I liked this format but it quickly grew on me and is the same style used in both audiobooks. While I like the audio, I own copies of both books as they’re definitely ones worth referring back to.

      "It's such a curiosity: if there is one thing we truly all have in common, is that we strive for something called a good life. We can claim that with a certainty and yet, when it comes to defining what makes our time on this planet good, we become less sure. Enter the Harvard Study! This book was written by two psychologists who have been taking care of the longest study on happiness ever conducted. It's a pretty famous study, there have been Ted talks and articles on it, but it deserves all the attention. A couple of scientists basically started tracking the health of a bunch of Harvard sophomores in 1938 (!) during the Great Depression. Every two years, the participants filled out questionnaires and were interviewed, most of them doing this for a lifetime and even many of their children ended up taking part in this as well and more people were added to the cohort, making the study comprise more than a thousand different people. After eighty years of collecting data we are now presented with an informative look on what makes a happy life. So yes, genetics matter, but. You know those people who like to claim that they just had bad luck, were born into a bad family and had more hardships than others? They might have had and certainly that plays a role in our levels of happiness. It's unfair and frustrating, but the good side of it is that the things we can't control, such as our temperamental wiring and how we process things, isn't playing the biggest role in determining how happy we end up being. It's the people in our lives! Probably the biggest revelation is that even more than physical health, our relationships with other people determine how happy we feel. Close ties to others can make us cope better with hardships and even delay physical and mental decline in later years. This book delivers the message with many examples of participants of the study and tells its tale in a way that I found very compassionate and touching. Waldinger and Schulz also go more in-depth about how to make relationships good. Being attentive is a big factor for example and it's spoken about how most of us work significantly less than our ancestors, while not feeling less stressed. It's a strange cultural phenomena that gets attributed to the vast quantity of stimuli we're exposed to and how giving our full attention to something, or in this case, someone, has become some desirable and precious. There are more chapters exploring specific aspects of the study's results. The role of money is addressed for example: so yes, having money does increase our wellbeing, but only to a certain degree. To say that the more money we've got, the happier we are isn't quite accurate. There are more little facts like these, all presented in a clear and empathetic manner, which I really enjoyed hearing about.Overall, the study is pretty famous and there exists tons of material that presents its results in a more condensed way, but if you enjoy a bit of storytelling and little fun facts, this is a great and uplifting read. Thanks to libro.fm, the publishers and authors for brining my attention to this.\n",

      "First of all, FUCK YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE.Second, I loved this book, the only reason it wasn’t five stars for me is because I was hoping for it to be more in depth than it was. It was a very quick read. It felt like it just scratched the surface, but I understand that I am not entitled to all the details of Britney’s life. Sexism in pop culture, mental health, and unfair/unjust conservatorships are the big talking points here and I think this book will bring awareness to these topics and hopefully spark change. I truly hope Britney finds the happiness and peace she deserves.\n",

      "I really enjoyed this on audio!! Over 15 hours in length, it's a big time commitment but listening to Harry share his story in his own words is totally worth it in my opinion!! Heartfelt and vulnerable, he shares stories from his childhood, about his mother, about life as a Royal, his military career and charitable work, meeting and falling in love with Meghan and their struggles being part of the Family and ultimately deciding to leave for their own safety and sanity. My respect for this couple is huge and I wish them nothing but the best! I'm sure he made a killing on this book deal but he has donated a significant amount to charities. If you are a fan of Harry or Meghan you definitely don't want to miss this!\n",

      "3.5  star  star  star  I listened to Prince Harry reading this on audible and I was surprised at how quickly I got through it (then again, I have the ability to listen to audiobooks at a ridiculous speed and still understand what's going on). As someone who is British and has been raised by a family that are very Royal Family orientated, it was kind of a no-brainer that I read this. I may not have been born when Princess Diana died, it is an event that to this day my family still talk about and feel; but no-one could feel as deeply as Prince Harry himself. Whilst I am not going to weigh in on the whole Harry and Meghan debate that everyone seems to be having, I will say that I understand why Harry and Meghan made the decision that they did. That being said, I think some of the things they did could have been done differently. That aside, this was actually an interesting book, but like many, I feel that there are probably a few details he could have spared us...\n",

      "Review: \n",
      "Royal family gossip is not really of any importance, so here are the parts of the book which actually matter (and I don't consider these spoilers because they have been all over the news):- Harry reveals he murdered 25 people in Afghanistan.- He compares murdering people to playing video games.- The victims \"were just chess pieces\" instead of actual people.Some have defended Harry by saying \"at least it's good that he owns up to it\" and \"he seems to have learned from it\".I, however, stronly disagree. Here are just a couple reasons why;- Harry implies he was \"only doing what he was told\". Not only is this a hideously bad excuse, it's also one that less privileged people wouldn't be allowed get away with.- He says the otherization of Muslims was part of military education. While without a doubt true, this is also another convenient way to downplay personal responsibility.- The rest of the book is basically Harry implying he's somehow now \"better\" than the rest of the cruel, racist, corrupt, criminal, bloodthirsty royal institution he used to be a part of (and in reality still is).What makes memoirs enjoyable is when the subject is truly willing to accept their own wrong-doings and take responsibility.Harry, clearly, is not.Nor will he ever face the consequences of his actions.Hence, this book shouldn't have been written at all.In its current state it's nothing but yet another slap in the face to those \"others\" to whom he, the Royals, the UK, and the rest of the Western war-criminals have caused immense pain and suffering with impunity.EDIT.Just to drive my point across, I'd like to share a particularly horrible section from the book:\n",
      "These were bad people doing bad things to our guys. Doing bad things to the world.If this guy I’d just removed from the battlefield hadn’t already killed British soldiers, he soon would. Taking him meant saving British lives, sparing British families. Taking him meant fewer young men and women wrapped like mummies and shipped home on hospital beds, like the lads on my plane four years earlier, or the wounded men and women I’d visited at Selly Oak and other hospitals, or the brave team with whom I’d marched to the North Pole. And so my main thought that day, my only thought, was that I wished Control had got back to us sooner, had given us permission to fire more quickly, so we’d got the other seven.And yet, and yet.Much later, speaking about it with a mate, he asked: Did it factor into your feeling that these killers were on motorbikes? The chosen vehicle of paps all over the world?Could I honestly say that, while chasing a pack of motorbikes, not one particle of me was thinking about the pack of motorbikes that chased one Mercedes into a Paris tunnel? Or the packs of motorbikes that had chased me a thousand times? I couldn’t say.\n",
      "Okay, a few comments on this:- It's 2023, and he is still trying to paint the invasion of Afghanistan as somehow moral and justified.- Notice how he uses the words \"take\" and \"remove\" instead of \"kill\" or \"murder\" when describing his own actions. Contrastingly, he has no problem referring to the people he shot as \"killers\".- Harry seeks compassion and understanding from everyone, but did he (or will he) show any to the people whose lives he destroyed? Of course not; they are, after all, just \"bad people\" doing \"bad things\".What a charming fellow.\n",

      "I went into this book with an open mind. I am not particularly invested in the British monarchy, but it's been pretty hard to exist over the past few years and not be aware of the way Harry and Meghan have made headlines around the world - the effects of which have been polarising.In choosing the format in which to consume this book, I decided on the audiobook because I wanted to hear Harry tell his own story. And honestly, I enjoyed every second of his telling of it. Not because it was particularly juicy or salacious, but I felt there was a genuine openness and honesty about him sharing some of the intimate details of his childhood, his life, and family dynamics that were, at times, incredibly sad and heartbreaking. The actual content of the book wasn't even about \"spilling tea\" - yes, he shared some personal moments that I felt provided a lot of clarity and context, but nothing that I thought was necessarily disrespectful to anyone. Enlightening, certainly, but not ill-intentioned. At least I didn't think so. He also didn't shy away from addressing his own mistakes and errors in judgement. He speaks about them frankly and his remorse felt genuine.I'm not here to make the case that Harry is not a privileged man, or that he hasn't had the world at his feet from the moment he was born. That's obvious. But to be fair to Harry, he's not making that argument either. However, having privilege doesn't make someone unworthy of empathy. What Harry is saying is that there are loads of lies about him and his wife that have been smeared across tabloids for years - some instigated by his own family - and instead of remaining silent and allowing others to dictate his narrative, he wants to tell his own story, from his perspective. The idea that he should just turn a blind eye to falsehoods that are constantly circulated about him for clicks is absurd - would any of us continue to remain loyal to an institution that continuously lies about who we are and remains silent when unfair attacks and vicious racist rhetoric is bandied about for sport? I think not.And honestly, I'm not interested in listening to the opinions of 1 star reviewers who read an excerpt out of context and now think they're qualified to share their misinformed opinions. Or people who out of spite rated a book poorly purely because they hate someone for merely breathing. To those people, check your priorities. No one has to like Harry or Meghan, nor does everyone have to agree with the decisions they've made. But the levels of hate directed at them for simply wanting to set the record straight is mind boggling to me. They have the right to share what their experiences have been like, and after 5.5 hours of listening, I can confidently say, I get it.\n",

      "Edited to clarify my thoughts on January 13, 2023This book was revealing, but also frustrating. Harry spares no punches rightfully pointing out where others have done wrong. However, he fails to consistently apply this same critical eye to his own actions. While he sounds like he feels bad for his missteps, he attributes them entirely to his upbringing with little interrogation. For example:1. Making a big deal of Will and Kate laughing at the Nazi costume. It was wrong of them to laugh and encourage him; however, it was more wrong of him to choose and wear the costume. 2.He lets himself off the hook for his Pakistani slur because he grew up sheltered and his one Pakistani friend forgave him.3. He physically attacks his bodyguard while drunk. 4. One passage that really struck me was “Meg said something I took the wrong way. It was partly a cultural difference, partly an language barrier, but I was overly sensitive that night. I thought: why is she having a go at me? I snapped at her-spoke to her harshly-cruelly…” Harry alludes to saying something awful to Megan, but never says what it was. Could it have something to do with his prior comments about her at the beginning of their relationship, which were quite judgmental for somehow who is sick of being judged by others.  Next to Harry, Prince Andrew gets the kindest treatment of the royals, being referred to only as \"embarrassing\"(he sounds more upset about Kate asking Meg to apologize for the baby brain comment). I didn't expect something earthshattering, particularly given his friendship with Eugenie, but I think Andrew's actions merit a bit of a harsher adjective than \"embarrassing\"Some more petty thoughts:I still don't believe WIlliam and Kate were huge Suits fans. The show is not that good. 2 I still don't believe Meghan never googled the Royals. She is an intelligent woman and that is literally the most basic thing you do for anyone. 3.I never want to hear about a frostbitten \"todger\" again. If this book accomplishes is to stop the belief that Meghan is a diabolical, controlling mastermind because no one looks good in this book, so I doubt she had any hand in it (she's far too PR savvy in a good way for that). This is all Harry (and his ghostwriter). One stylistic gripe: there were far too many chapters. The book was split into 3 parts, each with about 50-90 chapters. In a book under 500 pages. To me, this detracted from Harry and his GW's ability to actually write a compelling, cohesive narrative. Overall, this was fun, but would have been better with more self reflection. 3.5/5\n",

      "A bit conflicted on how to rate this, since the story Page tells is so important, gut wrenchingly honest, and NECESSARY considering all the crap that trans people and others in the LGBTQ+ community are now undergoing (AGAIN!) with the draconian measures being legislated by the Rethuglicans (sic) and other conservative forces worldwide. That story is never less than interesting and thought-provoking, and Page CAN write ... but there were a few issues. As many have pointed out, the author eschews a linear retelling of his life, in favor of bouncing around in time and attempting to tie things together thematically, or just as it occurs to him. Had I not just finished Andrew Rannells' new book right beforehand, which uses a similar template, that probably would have irked me more. But it IS sometimes difficult to tell just where you are timewise, especially as the actor rarely pinpoints such tales with what he is working on at the time, which might have provided welcome signposts to where in his life/career we are. At least one story from early on in the book is retold almost verbatim in the final chapters, the editor not catching it, or perhaps Page just wanting to reiterate it. And ofttimes, stories seem to dangle unresolved, or lead nowhere. Also, his partners are especially hard to keep track of, as they come and go with great frequency [NB: that isn't intended to be 'slut-shaming' - Page probably had far fewer partners than I did at his age - it's just difficult to keep them all ... ummm ... straight!]. Speaking of his career, frustratingly little insight is given into his work, and what there is seems kind of formulaic - i.e., 'I made this with so and so and either enjoyed it or didn't'. I'm not such a huge fan that I have seen everything he's done on film/TV, but there are some really odd omissions - most egregiously he never once mentions 'Freeheld', the brilliant and intense lesbian true story he both produced and starred in with Julianne Moore, which I would think would have been a highlight. And the audition process for 'Juno' is lined out - but not the actual making of the film ... and his trip to the Academy Awards for it is dispatched in a few sentences, focusing more on what they made him wear than anything else. For the most part, the prose is always at least competent, and ofttimes quite stirring; at other times, he reaches for something more poetic or flowery, and it lands with a clunk. But again, the story he wanted to tell is heartbreaking, and his anguish at coming to terms with his true self and owning that is both inspiring and admirable. I learned a lot about the trans experience I was not aware of, and if that's not worth 4 stars, I don't know what is...PS. Oddly BOTH Page and Rannells tell stories illustrating why Hugh Jackman is one of the nicest people in Hollywood - which is nice to know. As is the fact Kate Mara and Max Minghella are so ... progressive! :-O!\n",

      "Thank you, @atriabooks and @librofm, for the gifted book and ALC.During the pandemic, I was fortunate to have been made aware of Maggie Smith’s poetry, in the form of Keep Moving and the Keep Moving journal. I think the title says it all perfectly. Since then, I want to scoop up all her books, and I could not wait to read/listen to You Could Make This Place Beautiful, a memoir about Smith’s past marriage. She narrates audiobook. Maggie Smith hooked me from the start when she said that the book would not be the story of a bad man and a perfect woman (I’m paraphrasing). It absolutely wasn’t. She was open and vulnerable while still protecting the privacy of her ex husband, and especially, her children. Another thing she said that grabbed me was that this is obviously her deeply personal story, and she wasn’t sure if it would help anyone. I found many universal truths, and you may have seen my story shares of some of the passages. The title comes from a poem Smith wrote about motherhood that is filled with openings and universal truths many can relate to.Highly recommend the book and audio. Highly recommend anything by Maggie Smith. This will be a re-read many times over.Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com and instagram: www.instagram.com/tarheelreader\n",

      "Recommend with reservation. It feels awkward for me to say I didn't unrestrainedly love this book when I feel a lot of compassion for Beth Moore after reading it and sorrow for the hardship and ridicule she has endured. But, this is my honest review: First, the pros: I think Beth brings up a lot of areas where Christians can examine their own lives. I think she rightly condemns idolization of political parties, racism, and cover-ups of abuse within the Southern Baptist Convention. I personally feel convicted about judging Beth unfairly in the past without knowing more of her story. She seems like a woman who loves the Gospel and loves the Lord deeply and sincerely. Second, the cons: This is 100% personal preference, but I felt like her writing was sometimes unnecessarily flowery, and there were several chapters during the first half of the book where I got a bit bored. (I have several friends who loved her writing style though, so this is just me.) I also think that the book might be confusing (at best) or misleading (at worst) for someone who is unfamiliar with Christian celebrities, twitter wars, the SBC, and the complimentarianism vs. egalitarianism debate. I would recommend this book to a mature Christian who has studied the Word for themselves and has some understanding of those topics, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone new to the church.\n",

It took some perseverance to get through the first part that included an overwhelming amount of southern metaphors and accents, but I ended up being really moved by her story; mostly because it just seemed to be a humble and honest account of her life. It didn’t feel like she was trying to make a big point or compel readers to any side, but just shared her story in a real and basic way that acknowledged the pains and reality of life while also holding on to the good with gratitude. I teared up many times as she shared about the relatable realities of pain, brokenness, and impactful reminders of hope because it just felt so human. It wasn’t a call do be better or do better, but just a reflection on the Lord’s faithfulness as she’s experienced it.\n",

      "4.5 Stars! I don't normally do Content Warnings because I'm usually oblivious to what might trigger readers because my triggers are super weird and things that nobody else seems to have a problem with. But in this case I need you guys to be aware of what type of book this is. You may think that a Paris Hilton memoir will be light and fluffy but it is not. Paris talks in detail about her experiences at \"Emotional Growth Boarding Schools\" and this was a harrowing experience.Content Warnings: Rape, Grooming, Torture, Mental Abuse, Physical Abuse and Terrible Parenting First of all I'm wanna say Paris Hilton's Stars Are Blind is a bop and goes harder than it has any right to. That song isn't a Guilty Pleasure because I feel no Guilt. I'm a old person. I'm told I'm considered a \"Geriatric Millennial\" and I feel that. Kids I'm basically your grandmother. So believe me when I tell you youngsters that for about 5 years Paris Hilton was the most famous person on the planet. She was everywhere. I mean she was so famous that she made her friend Kim Kardashian famous. I'm not ashamed to say thst as a teenager The Simple Life was one of my favorite shows(Nicole Ritchie is an icon). The early 2000's was a wild time and I'm glad it's over because it was also horrible for women. Paris Hilton became one of the most hated women in the world simply because she liked partying and being famous. What's wrong with that? I don't know but it apparently it was horrible in 2006. This book did something I thought was impossible...it made Paris Hilton seem down to earth. I never would have thought that was possible be Paris Hilton comes across as a completely normal person who made tons of mistakes but learned from each of those mistakes. I know she has a documentary on YouTube that I plan to watch and she has a wedding special on Peacock which I probably won't watch but if you're interested maybe you will. I also listened to her album Paris from 2006 while reading this book and....it's very 2006 and I loved like only an old person could. In conclusion I hate Paris Hilton's parents...they are trash and belong in Hell. Paris is married now and is a mom so I'm hoping that she's happy and is able to be the kind of mother she never had. If you are a old person like me who remembers Paris Hilton being the Queen of the world, than I think you'll enjoy this book. I highly recommend this book to my fellow \"Geriatric Millennials\"!\n",

      "Revisionist history, with the actress looking back at her life and obviously filtering it through an adult creative-writing lens. Her headline-making discovery about her father only makes up a small part of this book. Some of the writing is incredibly awkward and overdramatic as she attributes lengthy thoughts and feelings to things that happened within a matter of seconds many decades ago. Then she starts blaming others for her bad decisions (such as not reporting a vague recollection of a childhood assault by a young friend) while claiming she was selfless, when in truth many of her choices were very self-centered and her parents weren't as bad as she wants us to believe they were.This would have been a more interesting story if written as a biography by an outside party; instead, we get high-school level prose mixed with self-revelation statements gleaned from too much therapy. The story could have been told in a straightforward manner that would have allowed us to draw our own conclusions; instead, Washington includes a lot of unnecessary retrospective inner thoughts that are difficult to believe and an attempt to shift blame while making her look heroic.Most frustrating is her need to continually push the race card, as if she personally dramatically suffered from her skin color (which we discover is very mixed and partially white). In truth she seemed to have it pretty good compared to many struggling Americans of any color. But she insists on saying things like, \"Even today, there is the inevitable code-switching and double consciousness required for survival as a (b)lack person in American.\" Right, that's how she made it so far and earns more than 99% of the people in the country? And why she capitalizes the b in black but doesn't capitalize the w in white?Then there's her politically correct way of making innocent any black male caught in a crime. \"Due to the biases of the justice system against African American men, the absence of a criminal record among the men in my father's family was rare. He had taken pride in being a statistical anomaly.\" She is looking back at discovering that her dad was pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug dealing, and that she as a teen wrote the judge begging for her dad's leniency because his \"costs were now also mine to bear.\" First, go back and check factual history about who commits crimes; second, stop blaming the \"system\" of holding accountable people who do wrong; and third, you don't deserve a \"get out of jail free\" card because of your skin color or that it's an undue burden on your family. She has an abortion without thought or guilt, though in another spot she gets on her knees to pray to God before filming a movie scene. She campaigns for her new pals the Obamas. She tells a bit about making her movies. She talks about how uncomfortable campaigning for an Oscar is. And mentions celebrating her birthday with Oprah. You know, all the things normal, everyday people that have suffered terribly go through. She proves herself to be a bit of a racist but as I compared her life story to mine and others I know, other than her parents' deceptions she had it better off from the start compared to most people. Her real problem is that she is looking at life with her head stuck under thick water, when it's time for her come to the surface and see the real world.\n",

And finally when I thought I had it all together another thing happened. \" You know? We don't get a lot of information about what her life was like before her drug habit. References to her previous relationships and lifestyle are made as offhand remarks or maybe a paragraph if we're lucky, so I still haven't gotten an idea about her as a person. Her experiences in jail that have led to her writing this aren't special, and I was looking for something that would actually help me understand why these experiences made the impact on her they did. Sure, yeah, traumatizing things, but there was no avenue for me to really put myself in her shoes and empathize throughout her narration.

Pub date: August 1, 2023. *Lara Love Hardin went from soccer mom of four kids to heroin addict behind bars to ghostwriter with the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Let me tell you, I couldn’t wait to read this book when I saw that pitch! I first saw the name Lara Love Hardin when I read the brilliant THE SUN DOES SHINE by Anthony Ray Hinton because Hardin’s name is on the front of the book! She was Hinton’s ghostwriter for his powerful story. *This book did not disappoint. The author didn’t sugar coat her struggle with addiction or how far she was willing to go to get that fix and how hard the transition from incarceration to “freedom” is, but ultimately this was such a redemptive story. Now in saying that I think it’s important to note, Hardin is a blonde, white woman and I know her story doesn’t fully reflect every experience of going from addiction —> jail/and or prison —> “normal” life. However, this is her story and experience and the fact of just how messed up our penal system is comes shining through. I also really enjoyed learning more about what exactly a ghostwriter is and a little behind-the-scenes of that world. Hardin is a phenomenal storyteller and writer and this read with such a great narrative flow. This was a fantastic memoir!\n",

I appreciated the boldness and honesty in which Sinclair described her father’s cruelty and how it affected her feelings and perspective on the world. I liked the vividness of her prose as well as her journey to escape her father’s influence and find her own voice through writing and education. There were a couple of reasons I didn’t love this memoir as much as many others on here. First, I found some of her writing a bit repetitive, especially in the first half of the book.

      "It is easy to see, from page one, why this is one of the most anticipated books of the Fall. Safiya Sinclair is an award winning poet, a woman who has lived many lives but who was forged first and foremost in her native Jamaica as the oldest child in a Rastafarian family. I admit to ignorance of this culture, of the extreme patriarchy at its heart, explicitly espousing the double standard. Sinclair credits her father's artistic side, but her accomplishments and those of her siblings arise from a wellspring of strength: \"My family lived in close quarters and knew the subtle dialect of each other's dreams.\" In this as in other examples, her prose rumbles like poetry, moving and dipping like the patois of her native country. As she matures she becomes more aware that her father's way of life is not necessarily correct, however she obediently adheres to the strictures he imposes until she finally is able to live her life as herself and not chattel to a man. It is the power of the written word, exemplified by poetry, that gives her the strength to find herself. And this book generously and honestly describes that journey.\n",

I was happy to see that Jinger was able to walk away from that and still have a relationship with Jesus and have a healthy relationship with Him. Unfortunately there is a lot of church hurt/religious trauma out there and this is just one of many examples. \n",

      "Had I remembered that I had read this author's first memoir, I would not have read this one. I picked it out as a recommendation, but did not connect it to her previous book. This book is less about her (though the first several chapters set the scene) and more about her father's death, and the trauma of her mother's illness and death during the pandemic.This is why I am not a fan. My dad died at 61, and it was not exceptional. Could he have had better health care? Yes, probably, but it was his own choice, and I believe, ultimately, the author's father made the same choice, ignoring what others had told him, and relying on his own, albeit faulty, instincts. My mother died at 39, and it was a fact, and there is a story, but not a book. The book feels a little sloppy, too drawn out: too many empty pages, too many repetitions, written in slightly different ways. It feels, as many books do these days, full of filler: i.e., here's a good writer that needs a certain number of words to make it worth a publisher's effort.Makes me think of the old commercial, Where's the beef? Where is the \"A-HA!\" moment? When will I reach the part where I think, wow, the reviewers were right, and not just accepting free books in exchange for their \"inflated star rating\" opinions?I dunno. Maybe I am being mean, because it is well written. It's just very light on substance, and makes me think twice, thrice, about the honesty of its high star ratings.\n",

      "David Grann has a knack for finding neglected stories, researching them deeply, and then turning them into immensely readable books:The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, and now this tale.And what a tale it is! During the War of Jenkins’ Ear between England and Spain (you all remember that one, right?), a small fleet of British warships set out in search of a legendary Spanish ship known to travel to and from the New World with cargoes of gold and silver. Their route would take them around Cape Horn, arguably the most treacherous passage on the high seas. During this Atlantic-to-Pacific ordeal, which lasted months, all of the ships were separated.Grann’s story focuses on The Wager, a converted merchant ship that ultimately made the turn to the Pacific but then foundered on rocks surrounding an island off the coast of Chile. Several sets of castaways from The Wager eventually made it back to England, producing differing written versions of what ensued before and after the shipwreck.These documents allowed Grann to introduce three characters vividly: the Wager’s captain, the gunner, and a teenage midshipman named Byron (grandfather to the poet); and to sketch in more lightly many other individuals. He ably uses his three principals to describe the character of a British naval ship of the time, and distills from the multiple recountings a reasonably clear picture of events. The Admiralty, back in England, undertook much the same task regarding the events, but with a very different motivation, one that at first seems surprising but ultimately makes a great deal of sense, from their perspective. It is not, I hope, divulging too much to comment on two issues that dramatically reduced the number of healthy men on the ships even before they reached the Cape: typhus and scurvy. The causes of both these diseases were unknown at the time but their effects were horrific, both for their victims and the ability of the remaining crews to persevere in the face of so many challenges. The nature of the story, Grann’s narrative skills, and the work of the narrator, Dion Graham, swept me along. Not a single dull sequence, but nothing overwrought either. Highly recommended for those interested in naval history - or adventure.\n",

      "It was many years after the inception of NASA and the space flight program that women were allowed to become astronauts. Though not all of these initial six women are household names today, they all worked to advance both space exploration and women's rights in their own ways.It rather surprises me that I'm not very interested in space exploration - maybe because I think there's plenty here on Earth to occupy my attention. My mother, on the other hand, is a fanatic whose biggest goal in life is to one day make it to the moon and so I am kept abreast of any advancements in space exploration. However, I am interested in the people who actually made it up into orbit - the whys and hows of it - and so I was excited to read this book about the first six women accepted to NASA as astronauts.The author devotes equal time to all six women, tracing them from childhood to show us what got them interested in becoming astronauts and how their skills and personalities led to them making it through the grueling selection process. We follow them through training, their missions in space and the advancements through the ranks of astronauts, ending with the tragic death of Judy Resnik and her colleagues in the Challenger disaster, and the investigation afterward. I enjoyed how the author did not show the women as a monolith and let us get to know them all on an individual level.However, I did wish that the book went into more detail about the scientific aspects of what the women did on their flights to space. We go into their experiences and how the media and the public reacted to the novelty of women in space, but I would have liked to see more about the more routine aspects of their job as well. It also became tricky at times to keep track of the many people in the six's lives, especially their fellow astronauts, so I wished the cast of characters at the start of the book had included them as well.Disclaimer: I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley. This is my honest and voluntary review.\n",

      "4.5Thank you @simon.audio for the complimentary audiobook. A fascinating look at the first SIX women who were astronauts. We see their childhood, education, advanced education, and careers that lead them into the space program. They paved the way in a difficult time for women to be seen as serious in the working world. Many obstacles were handled by them with such civility and grace towards their counterparts (men). Done very well in audiobook format. I found myself looking up details and the women online to get a deeper sense.\n",

      "45% of the book was about the Salem witch trials it was very interesting and what I was interested in. The second 45% of the book was basically a story about the founding fathers the 13 original colonies and the rise to independence. The last 10% of the book was about the original story That inspired the book in the movie the exorcist. While all of it was interesting and worth reading. I was disappointed that only the first 45% approximately was actually about the Salem witch trials. The epilogue and wrapup of the book mentioned how throughout history and even in today’s world That the world is on a witchhunt in Safari as our council culture social justice and other issues going on in the world. Once again it was all interesting but I wish the entire book was about the Salem Witch trials and more information about that in general.\n",

      "And so begins the fascinating first half of this book.I am thoroughly impressed with the writing and information presented throughout the first half. It focuses solely on the witch trials themselves and the people most closely involved.The second half takes a bit of a turn, moving onto the lasting effects of the trials and the ways in which the lessons learned (or not learned) helped the founders build America. This part I found a bit longwinded, and I wonder if perhaps the publisher insisted on a particular page count and that is why it ended up going off on this track.The end of the book comes back to modern witchcraft and black magic, witch-hunts, exorcisms, and modern-day Salem, which I think is very fitting.Regardless, as someone who already knows quite a bit about the trials, I did overall enjoy the book.

      "It took me a long time to read King: A Life…about three weeks, which is much longer than it probably should have taken. It wasn’t that the book was boring. Far from it. In fact, Jonathan Eig’s new biography is much more interesting and exciting than most in the genre. It took me so long because I had to put it down after every chapter or two to absorb what I had read and think about things. I had a rudimentary knowledge of who Martin Luther King was from learning about it in school. I knew that King was about peaceful protest, equality and freedom…and I knew that he was assassinated. Beyond that, I didn’t really know much and to be honest, I probably only knew that much because I grew up in Memphis. Schools don’t spend a lot of time on civil rights in general (mainly during February for obvious reasons), but what little is taught revolves around King. The reason for this is that many people feel that the Civil Rights Movement doesn’t matter much anymore because racism is no longer a problem. This is far from the truth, especially in the southern United States. Jonathan Eig has authored a biography of a great man who was flawed, uncertain and afraid. King was the leader of a movement that brought about change in a country that fought (and still fights) change with every fiber of it’s being. He worked with other great men and women to secure rights for black Americans that many never thought possible. He didn’t always do the right thing and made missteps along the way. Eig doesn’t gloss over King’s mistakes and the book is all the better for it because it humanizes a man who ultimately became a mythic figure who is perceived by many to be “perfect”, which is far from the truth. Eig presents King as a human who is as flawed as the rest of us but was able to do great things in spite of that, which is what King would have wanted in my opinion. Many people will look to things like King’s adultery and try to diminish his accomplishments (just like the FBI did). This is a flawed argument because King never claimed to be perfect and his personal failures have little or nothing to do with his accomplishments for society as a whole. He was not a messiah and never claimed to be. He simply worked to inspire people and in that he succeeded completely and without question.This is not the first biography of MLK and it certainly won’t be the last, but it will likely be known as the best. King: A Life is exhaustively researched and includes interviews with people who were there, recently declassified FBI files and previously available information. To get the most from the book, I would recommend taking the time to digest what you read. While it is extremely well-written and flows in such a way that you want to continue reading, I would encourage you to put it down every so often to reflect on just what happened during the 50’s and 60’s in the United States. Think about the injustices that occurred and are still occurring today. Feel for the people who have suffered and feel pride in the people who stood up for what was right in the face of impossible odds. A much as this may be simply an interesting biography, it is more than that. This is a testament to the man who gave his entire life over to making the world a better place as well as the people who helped him. This is a book that should make you uncomfortable, sad, angry and afraid. This is a book that should remind you of the difference between right and wrong. This is also a book that should give you hope and inspiration. Thank you to Netgalley and Farrar, Straus and Giroux for providing me with an ARC of King: A Life.\n",

      "Една от репликите на участник в събитията в книгата много ми допадна, и е валидна независимо от епохата. А именно, че хората имат нужда от две неща: от нещо по-голямо от самите тях, в което да вярват; и от нещо по-малко от самите тях, което да мразят.———Ку Клукс Клан се основава на заложеното в Конституцията на Конфедерацията на Южните Щати от 1861 г. неотменимо човешко право … на робовладелство. Разделението на висши и низши раси се приема за дадено от Господ Бог, така че е абсолютно наложително част от човешките същества да са инвентарна собственост на други, и - това вече не го пише - да произвеждат безплатно, безропотно и без прекъсване икономическите блага на висшата раса.Паметници на Джеферсън Дейвис (президент на Конфедерацията) и Ръбърт Е. Лий (най-известният и генерал) и до днес красят южните щати. Или, според друг участник от книгата - Северът и аболиционистите печелят войната, но робовладелците и Югът печелят мира. Това е видно и през 21-ви век.———Та да се върнем на Ку Клукс Клан. През 20-те години на ХХ в. те са в стихията си. Освен традиционните южни щати, се присъединяват много нови привърженици и от северните. Северняците бързо се “стресират” от вътрешната емиграция на чернокожите от южните щати, търсещи някакъв незастрашен начин на живот. Куклуксовците са учители, търговци, адвокати, съдии, полицаи, сенатори и губернатори. Де факто те са хората, които всеки ден срещаме край дома и работата. Всички те полагат клетва пред Клана да бранят традиционните американски и християнски ценности и да се борят с демократично-либералния упадък в Америка. Никакъв алкохол; целомъдрие и никакъв извънбрачен секс; приети и приложени на практика закони за стерилизация на низшите същества, базирани на строгите “доказателства” на евгениката; никаква теория на еволюцията в училищата - земята е създадена за 6 дни от Бог и точка; никакви емигранти, които са низша раса, и съответното законодателство е прието бързо; евреите, католиците и черните - ами да ги няма, а и те са враг номер 1, повече и от емигрантите. Изобщо сегрегацията като законодателство (“законите на Джим Кроу”) и техническа ра��ка (например черен няма право да стъпи в жилищен район с бели без съгласието на всички живущи в него) се циментира най-вече от провържениците на клана. А шествията с десетки хиляди маскирани участници и още повече публика в големите градове свидетелстват за властта в сянка, дублираща на практика почти всички официални обществени структури в САЩ.Достопочтените куклусовци са заети денонощно. През деня ходят на работа и на църква. През нощта - маскирани и въоръжени - палят кръстове, сплашват, изтезават, изнасилват, убиват и мародерстват. Полицията е с тях - те са част от маскираните. Целят се и в президентска кандидатура, имат си вестници, тиражират активно лъжливи новини и слухове към целеви групи, имат си и собствено малко киностудио. Стълбове на обществото и патриоти. Единственият - лек - пробив в редиците им идва, когато през 1925 г. лидерът на северното крило е заловен и осъден за рядко брутално изнасилване и убийство, и излежава 25 годишна присъда. Но това съвсем не е нито краят, както откровено залъгва заглавието, нито дори чак толкова драматичен трус за клана. Те просто спират с публичния PR и се снишават под радара. Там са и днес - просто с времето са били принудени да поотстъпят към нормалността, и то значително. ———Книгата описва доста прилично атмосферата, основните идеи и задачи на клана. Описва мотивацията и ползите да си член на това бляскаво рицарско братство или на тази отвратителна терористична организация - зависи от гледната точка. Това, в което авторът не успява, са две неща. Първото е липсата на широк обзорен поглед над по-голяма част от куклусовската панорама. Използван е съдебният процес за един единствен период - 1925 г, и за един единствен щат - Индиана. Второто е твърде протяжно и тясно фокусиране над сензационно-пикантните моменти от конкретното престъпление над конкретната жертва. Че то е ужасно, спор няма. Но цялата куклуксовска мръсотия се размива в индивидуалната психопатия само на един човек. Кланът е страшен именно защото неговите участници масово са отчайващо банални и обикновени, и са далеч от този профил. Нацистите ненапразно са се учили от Ку Клукс Клан по отношение на законодателна рамка и технология.Оптимизмът от подзаглавието е напълно неоправдан. —————— play_button  Цитати:  kitchen_knife  “I did not sell the Klan in Indiana on hatreds,” Stephenson said. “I sold it on Americanism.” kitchen_knife  “One month after the attack on the bellhop, the Klan held a large parade in downtown Dallas, marching with banners that read “Pure Womanhood, Our Little Girls Must Be Protected” and “One Hundred Percent American.” kitchen_knife  “Stephenson organized recruiters in all parts of the state and trained them to appeal to three things:\t\t\tLove of mystery and ritual.\t\t\tPride of race and religion.\t\t\tHatred.” kitchen_knife  “The Klan made life less dull; it gave meaning, shape, and purpose to the days.

      "An interesting - and terrifying - book about viruses and how they have affected human history. Some of the epidemics mentioned make Covid look like a light cold. 60% of Europeans killed during the Black Death! 60 million dead out of a population of 95 million during another viral outbreak. The numbers are truly staggering. With the world's population heading for 10 billion a pandemic on this kind of scale will bring death and suffering of unimaginable proportions. And what is most frightening is the inevitability. Long before Covid, epidemiologists have been predicting such an occurrence. Post-Covid they're still predicting it. For many epidemiologists we got off lightly with coronavirus-19. And still millions died and economies crashed. With antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics growing and ecosystems collapsing, we might not have to wait long for 'the big one'. And when it comes we will be as woefully unprepared as we were for Covid. And the anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers and free marketeers will make it even more difficult to prevent. Before we know it we will be back to blaming the Jews for poisoning the wells. Given that some believe Covid vaccinations are an instrument designed by Bill Gates to take over the world, I guess we're already there. Such thinking seems so innate in such a large proportion of the human population that - however clever and rational we believe we are - it will be ignorance and superstition that finally does for us. For if there is one lesson we should all have learned by now it's that you can't beat nature. A quick note about the writing. Easy to read and informative, the book covers a great deal of ground. Kennedy's knowledge is broad, but - presumably because of word count and accessibility - shallow. But that doesn't take away from any of his key points. His basic conclusion that for us to survive as a species we need to come together more and cooperate is not exactly new. But given how bad we are at it, it does need restating. And as all those wonderful doctors and nurses and scientists - from all countries around the world - during the Covid pandemic have shown, we can do it. Whether we can when the virus really hits the fan I'm not so sure.\n",

      "Enjoyable; lots was a review of much I’d read earlier about the Astor’s ostentatious wealth, the Four Hundred and the Gilded Age. Fans of recent HBO series would recognize characters based on them. As the family grew, became increasingly eccentric and lost its centre, their history lost its vitality. The “fun”, if you want to describe a historical rendition in such a way, is that the book does seem more akin to gossip through the ages. Anderson Cooper’s mother Gloria Vanderbilt knew many of the descendants; that familiar, slightly condescending writing style permeates the book; we are meant to all be less than impressed by the glitz, snobbery and grand show put on by John Jacob Astor whose origins were lowly. His brutality in acquiring his wealth, as America expanded westward, does remind us of the free wheeling Colonialism/Manifest Destiny beliefs which were more self- serving than ideological. The photos were pretty great. A few beauties and some ugly rich men; trappings of great wealth. It’s a bit like reading a long People magazine editorial. Very American history!\n",

      "Review: \n",
      "If you are looking for an exhaustive history of the Astor family, this book isn’t it. Just like Anderson Cooper’s previous book about his family, Vanderbilt, it’s written in dated chapters, one or two only tangentially related to the subject, that pretty much highlights a few points in the family history. I learned how the Astor family got rich and about a theater massacre that makes absolutely no sense in a modern context. I was definitely interested. I do however find Cooper’s writing entertaining and informative, even if it’s not the in depth gossip I want his books to be. Maybe it’s a sense of loyalty to the names his lineage has allowed. He skirts the scandal I hope to learn about while giving me just enough details of the hush hush rumors of the time to keep me from feeling short changed. He wants to keep his name clean of just being associated with low brow gossip. I do find both his books, Vanderbilt and Astor, to be more books of context that have helped me fill in blank spaces in other books I’ve read than in depth historical review. If you read historical fiction that takes place in New York or even nonfiction that takes place in the area, Cooper’s books help add color and depth to the image of the Gilded Age, complete with all its squalor. And I will more than likely read his next one. Here’s hoping it’s the Rockefellers, Morgans, or Carnengies, and please let it be more scandalous.\n",

      "Rating: 4.5“The Earth Transformed” by Peter Frankopan is an ambitious project with the aim of looking at the history of the Earth & its inhabitants as we know it through the lens of the environment and climate that arguably shaped us into what and who we are now.Fashioned into twenty-five chapters, each chapter focuses on different centuries, starting from 'the world from the dawn of time (c.4.5bn-c.7m BC) up to where we are now, 'on the edge of ecological limits (c.1990-today)'. Throughout this journey through time, Frankopan presents readers with an overview of ancient civilizations and their interaction with nature and how this dynamic evolved into the current trend of humankind's exploitation of natural resources. As an aside: I appreciate how Frankopan's overview is atypical in that it is not overly Eurocentric as most other historical non-fiction can be, as it talks about all of the continents with the available data he had managed to gather.Armed with numerous facts from other historical data and text, Frankopan postulates how the climate, landscape, and flora & fauna of each continent play a role in the development of how human's societies shaped themselves, up to the point that these societies grew into larger and more complex civilization when globalization and trading became more widespread as the centuries moved along.It's not hard to see that there are cyclical patterns to human interaction with nature, not when the author has laid it all out for us to see. Based on this exhaustive data-driven book, it's clear that climate disasters and epidemics have helped to provide a 'check and balance' to the population trends throughout the millenniums. However, starting from the industrial revolution, it is the humans themselves who are courting & propelling along more such climate disasters and epidemics. Due to our rapacious need to extract natural resources from the Earth with little regard as to its limitations (not to mention the pollution due to the by-products of such extraction), we are now hastening the doom that has been 'prophesized' by climate scientists from centuries before this.Not gonna lie, it's hard not to feel bleak when reading this kind of book, not least when the author himself seems to be going through it with the final paragraph of his book:\n",
      "The UK government's Office for Budget Responsibility recently put it, it is easy to answer the question of how the problem of climate change is solved: it would be nature, rather than human action, that ultimately brings net emissions towards zero. It will do so through catastrophic depopulation, whether through hunger, disease or conflict. [...] Perhaps we will find our way back there through peaceful means; a historian would not bet on it.\n",
      "And honestly? I kind of agree with him. It's hard not to be pessimistic when historical data have shown again and again that humans do not care for the repercussions of their own actions until they are finally paying the final price for it. I would say that this is a great book to read to better understand how civilizations have blundered repeatedly in their mismanagement of the Earth, and it's a book that is best taken in small doses (otherwise you will experience high blood pressure every time you stumble upon yet another bumbling mistake made by humankind). It's an eye-opening book and a timely one given the state of today's world. Best to know what we are up against rather than continue to believe that all will be well again so that we are better prepared for when nature inevitably comes for us.Thank you to Definitely Books for the review copy.

It is an amazing story that fosters resiliency, determination and bravery. It shows us that we are all human and what we live through makes us who we are. It was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at times. A relatively short read, I’m glad I read it. It was interesting to hear (albeit second hand) what a person thinks and feels that has lived so long. I only hope I get the same opportunity Charlie did.

      "Nonfiction that reads like fiction! This is no mean feat and difficult to achieve but Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch have certainly done it. The book is about the true story of the conspiracy to assassinate the three leaders - Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin, and Franklin Roosevelt while they meet in Tehran, Iran. But there’s so much more than just this plot - the political intrigue, the setting of the stage way before the so-called attempt, the characters - all so well done. I particularly enjoyed the up close and personal characterization of the people in the book, especially the three leaders. One point I appreciated being emphasized is that the Soviet Union bore the brunt of casualties during World War II, a point that doesn’t get much play in the West. Millions of Soviet military and civilians lost their lives, the war having been fought on their lands. I enjoyed the negotiating strategies deployed by both Roosevelt and Stalin and the sustained pressure they applied on a reluctant Churchill (understandably so) to commit to Operation Overlord. This book was fast-paced and kept my interest. It humanized every individual in the book, friend or foe, as it set out to unveil the plot that could have changed the course of history. An enjoyable read and I definitely recommend it. Many thanks to the authors, publisher, and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review this book.\n",

      "I'm a fan of Brad Meltzer, but I've yet to read one of his nonfiction books with Josh Mensch until now. This book is about a plot by the Nazis to assassinate President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin when they met in Tehran to outline and plan strategy for ending World War II and forcing the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. The book is well researched and reads like Meltzer's fiction. It has short chapters and they do a great job of building the tension that the Big 3 must've been facing at this period. It's not dry at all and I like that we saw it from each side's point of view. I also liked that there weren't any huge info dumps in any of the chapters. Overall a great read! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history or is a World War II buff. Thank you to Flatiron Books, authors Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch, and NetGalley for gifting me a digital copy of this book. My opinions are my own.\n",

      "4.5 Unsung heroes. Life's better angels and people who care, people desperately needed. The homeless. The unhoused. Those people many turn away from, not seeing them as human. Another social problem that our great country cannot solve, like poverty, hunger, guns and the violence they wrought. In Boston, they are attempting to do something about it and this book introduces us to some of our better angels and those they try to help.Kidder writes terrific narrative non fiction that pulls the reader in and makes them see and realize the scope of the problem. Dr. Jim O'Connell, became a physician later in life than many and finds the homeless his vocation. He is also rather funny and self deprecating, which is needed in this book where many of the people we meet tugged at my heart strings.\n",

      "**SPOILER FREE**With the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland having simmered over two decades ago, the conflict has gone from one of global attention to a footnote of history. Millennials and Gen Zers who grew up in the 9/11 era are familiar with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, their causes, consequences, and participants, but would need the aid of Google to know who Gerry Adams or Bobby Sands is. Coyly dubbed “The Troubles,” the 30-year period of violent conflict surrounding the British occupation of Northern Ireland is relatively unknown amongst younger generations, making its stories excellent subject matter, as they are filled with the tales of spy craft and deceit that make historical accounts read like espionage thrillers.Rory Carroll’s \"There Will Be Fire\" zooms in on one specific event of The Troubles, the Irish Republican Army’s bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, England that almost killed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The book follows the life and account of the bomber Patrick Magee, his target Thatcher, and the numerous British police agencies trying to catch him. Where the book thrives is in its detailed reporting, which, with much skill from Carroll, caries the tension of a blockbuster thriller. Carroll is a talented writer, describing the act of bomb-making and defusing as a walk on the razor’s edge. Readers will feel the “eureka” moments of discovery along with the police agents, which come after months of sifting through mugshots and manually comparing fingerprints. But while the storytelling is superb, There Will Be Fire fails in its lack of context and unexplained causes of The Troubles and the motivations of its participants. The book spends a lot of time with Margaret Thatcher, detailing her rise through the Conservative Party to become the first female Prime Minister. It’s clear Carroll is fond of her, as she is portrayed as a stern, unwavering force, undeterred by Irish bombs or English sexism. Unfortunately, no such exposure is provided for Patrick Magee or his compatriots. Besides a brief exploration of Magee’s family life, Carroll omits any explanation of why he, or any others, joined the Irish Republican Army. (Or, why the IRA existed in the first place.) While Thatcher is lauded for her heroism, the lack of provided motivations for those trying to kill her leaves the impression that the Republicans (people who want a united Ireland free from British rule) simply “hate the Brits” and “enjoy killing.” In reality, the reasons for Irish Republicanism, both militant and pacifist, are much more nuanced.Ireland suffered over 800 years of English colonialism, with a reprieve for the southern part of the nation coming in the early 20th century. The six counties of the north, which are still considered British territory, became a hotbed for Britain’s anti-Catholic prejudice, state violence, and all-out murder. Never does There Will Be Fire mention the many institutionalized prejudices the British government imposed on Catholics, such as voting restrictions, forced unemployment, and “internment,” the process of imprisoning “suspected” Republicans without trial. It borders on malpractice that Carroll never includes Bloody Sunday, when British paratroopers shot 26 unarmed civil rights marchers, as a catalyst for Irish armed resistance. He also omits the extent torture was used on Irish prisoners, the British government’s use of military and paramilitary death squads, and Margaret Thatcher’s attempt to get the Ulster Volunteer Force, the pro-British counterpart of the IRA, to assassinate the President of Ireland. Instead, the reader is given a rosy picture of “The Iron Lady,” one that her Conservative Party biographer could have written.In not providing the proper context for Magee’s actions, Carroll fails his readers by giving the impression The Troubles could be boiled down to “good vs. evil.” In actuality, both the IRA and the British government have apologized for their actions on numerous occasions. Not only does a one-sided depiction not provide the full story of The Troubles, but it is dangerous. To avoid future conflicts, in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, we must properly understand what drives someone to plant a bomb or torture a prisoner. Only with a thorough understanding of others’ reasonings can we prevent violence. Carroll’s account fails in this, as it misleads its readership into thinking there are “good guys” (Thatcher) and there are “bad guys” (Magee). Through that lens, humans will continue to misunderstand each other, and conflict will follow.Though the prose is superb and the story is worthy of exploration, the half-tale of There Will Be Fire severely limits the book's potential. I give it 2 stars and would steer anyone interested in learning about the entirety of The Trouble to read Say Nothing instead.\n",

      ". I will preface this review with the fact that I am a huge Ziwe fan. Her style of interviewing is not just funny but also unapologetically willing to call out people on things they’d rather not be called out for. I’m sad it took me so long to get to her book but it was worth the wait. She is funny in her point blank observations of the world. She shared anecdotes from her personal life, cloaked in humor, that made me laugh but the moments themselves were not remotely funny. That is a gifted comedian and truth teller in my opinion. \n",

Ziwe brings this combination of earnestness and humor, you can tell she takes her work seriousness yet also loves it. It's heartwarming. She takes us through a journey of her life, from failures to successes and on the way, touches themes of immigration, Blackness, her family, ambition, and more. I've never heard of her before yet I still really enjoyed this! There's something so friendly and snarky in the writing that makes this an easy read. Anyways, first book of 2024!

For the first probably 30% I was absolutely loving it, as I found her someone I really related to. However, that changed partway through. While aspects of her life and her stories continued to resonate, threads started to emerge that made me deeply uncomfortable, specifically how she discusses her mother-in-law and her children. If I were her family and read this book, I would be deeply hurt. She spends lots of time on the page explaining why they should not be hurt, but ultimately, she is narcissistically (her word) attached to her own ideas and perceptions at the expense of others in her own close circle, including her own children. I've deleted everything else I want to say about this book, as I recognize that I am discussing a real-life person and want to respect that.\n",

      "Really torn on how to rate this one because there were essays that I loved and really related to, but then there were also moments where I kind of felt like reading about her life was a little, ahem, boring (and I'm saying that as someone who also leads a fairly boring life). I liked that there was a story that ran throughout the book in between the other essays and gave it some structure. However, I'm kind of sad that that story was more about buying another apartment in New York than the author's relationship with her dad and processing her grief after he died. (The title story about the ugly couch was about both of those things, so she really could have taken it either direction. Maybe some of her other books focus more on that relationship.)I did find myself wanting to highlight many things, a few of which I'm including here for safekeeping:I loved the part about therapy in the chapter with her unpopular opinions. As someone who has thought many times about going to therapy but then ultimately deciding against it, I found it very validating. I particularly loved this quote from Mychal Denzel Smith in a New York Times article: \"Therapy can offer a pathway toward understanding [the self], but it can also overshadow the idea of healing in community.\" In that same chapter, she confessed her dislike of open floor plans. I feel the same. I prefer to not have an open view of my kitchen from the front door. Also, her painful admission about wanting to avoid joining various groups in the community hit a little too close for me: \"My greatest fear was that someone would demand more of me than I was willing to give, emotionally or logistically.\" Hence why I've never joined the PTA. She referenced \"life-changing advice about mothers-in-law\" from her friend's mom but then never said what that advice actually was, and I desperately want to know.And finally, just loved this one: \"When I see cracks or brittleness, where I used to complain or gloat, I now feel love. That's not my doing. That's a poultice of time and mercy. I am able to grieve what I wanted but didn't get and, well, move on.\"\n",

      "I received an advance copy via NetGalley.If you love the movie Airplane!, read this book. It's a hoot. I knew absolutely nothing about the story behind the movie or about the three main creators, Jewish boys from Wisconsin. I hadn't heard of Kentucky Fried Theater or even the Kentucky Fried Movie. Even so, the story kept me engaged from page one. It doesn't follow a typical narrative nonfiction format with blocks of information. Instead, it flows in the form of an interview, with Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker, and many other essential people throughout the process chiming in with their experiences. There are also many notes from other major comedians of recent decades who were influenced by Airplane! One thing that threw me off at first was the absence of a chronological flow. The book jumps back and forth through time from the making of Airplane, to the formation of the core group, then back to Airplane, and so on. I can see why they did it that way--most everyone is reading to find out about Airplane, not what happened in Madison in the early 1970s--and overall I feel it worked, because I kept reading. It was odd, though--which I suppose should be expected in consideration of the wits involved.Some of my favorite bits were about how the actors were cast, how the Jive dialogue developed and how the famed \"Mrs. Cleaver\" learned her lines, and how many of the jokes evolved. Nothing was actually ad-libbed. It mostly stayed on script, though there were a few strokes of brilliance on filming day.\n",

      "I was 14 when Airplane! hit theaters in summer 1980, and while I lacked the perspective to know just how radical and groundbreaking it was, I certainly knew it was absolutely hilarious and I saw it multiple times in an attempt to get all of the jokes. It remains one of my all-time favorite movies, and I never fail to laugh throughout.So of course when this book was announced I preordered it and started reading soon after it was released. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do - a verbal history of the origins of ZAZ and Airplane! all the way through release and massive success.The story is told in a way that feels like Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker sitting around chatting. Historical context is largely provided in sidebars from actors, producers, and others involved with the movie as well as younger comedy actors/directors influenced by the movie.I’ve seen this description for others things in the past but it really came though as I read: just because Airplane! is funny doesn’t mean that a description of how it was made would be funny - or even particularly interesting. This book is informative - it isn’t funny.For Airplane! being one of my all-time favorite movies, this is one of my least favorite books in the last couple of years. As I said it is informative - you definitely get a sense of everything that happened. But without contextual weighting sometimes the stories go on way too long and significant chunks really drag aimlessly. And since it isn’t particularly funny, those dragging sections are hard to come back to.Finally, the added context are really a mixed bag - Julie Hagerty, Bob Hayes, and other actors and producers all provided interesting information that felt like it was edited and focused to add value. (Unlike the main text). More recent people like Bill Hader, Trey Parker and others provided a great deal of modern perspective, but occasionally there were sections that added nothing - having Tim Allen drop in an unrelated grumpy anti-PC ‘in my days’ comment including a statement about how “I miss comedy” really annoyed me at a point that the appeal of the book had basically worn off already.Will you like this? Depends - are you expecting it to be funny or just a chronicle of ZAZ journey from their youth in the Midwest to LA to continue and eventually get into making Airplane? If the former - move along, very few laughs here. If the latter, you might just enjoy it. And if you tie it in with watching Kentucky Friend Movie and Airplane! there is definitely added value (but nothing later, as there are no details of their later work aside from brief mentions in the epilogue). For me reading this seemed inevitable - but not particularly rewarding.\n",

      "Enjoyable read for fans of this movie though it spends too much time on their Kentucky Fried days. Maybe they didn’t think they had enough material solely for a book about Airplane. Also, I am not surprised that Jim Abrams admitted his heart really wasn’t in some of his later movies such as Mafia. I was in college and did a brief internship during the casting stage of that movie. Even though I was in college and had no experience reading scripts, I thought the script for Mafia was terrible. And though I knew Jim Abrams was a legend due to Airplane, I always had the sensation that he would rather have been somewhere else. He wasn’t necessarily unfriendly to me or anyone else, but you never would have guessed that he was one of the people behind possibly the greatest comedies of all time. He seemed kind of dour and over it. Still, hard to argue with Airplane and this book is a must for fans of the movie\n",

      "2015: A young man goes into the wilderness and disappears.2016: A young man goes into the wilderness and disappears.2017: A young man goes into the wilderness and disappears.In Trail of the Lost, Lankford chronicles three disappearances on the Pacific Crest Trail—Chris Sylvia, Kris Fowler, and David O'Sullivan—and the efforts made to find them. A park-ranger-turned-nurse, she got involved in one of the unofficial searches almost by accident, but once she was in, she couldn't turn away.I read Lankford's Ranger Confidential in 2016, and it left me with the sense that she had loved her work but was deeply burnt out by the time she left. This proved to be a better fit of a book for me, partly because I adore both thru-hiking books and search-and-rescue memoir, but also because Lankford is uniquely qualified to write it. Lankford more than had the qualifications to take part in the search efforts, and she proves here that she also has the research and writing skills to weave a very complicated story. This is three stories in one, mixed with numerous others—because inevitably, over the course of years of searching and researching, Lankford and the scrappy team of searchers she was involved with stumbled across, or were asked to investigate, other missing-persons cases. No spoilers, but what the investigations turned up varied widely.Most missing-person cases in the wild are resolved quickly, but that was not to be the case for any of these three. It makes for a twisty and turny ride, with leads including a cult, multiple psychics, questionable science (read: the kind of science that the book is here to critique, not to promote), drone footage, solo accidents, accidents involving other people, and much more.One thing that might turn some readers off: Lankford has a tendency of mentioning mental illness in the context of crime (\"...a thirty-two year-old man with a history of mental illness...\" (loc. 3148*); \"...mentally ill fugitive...\" (loc. 3638); \"...attacked by a mentally deranged man\" (loc. 4539); etc.). It's never a main point of the story, but then, neither is any of these individuals' mental health relevant to whatever parts of the story Lankford tells. Again, not a big enough part of the story for me to draw conclusions, but enough to mention...and to remind anyone who is still reading that people with mental illness are far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than to commit them themselves.Overall, a fast and gripping read if you're drawn to wild spaces, mysteries, and stories taking place in the intersection of those things. May be of interest to readers of Kathryn Miles' Trailed and Jon Billman's The Cold Vanish.Thanks to the author and publisher for providing a review copy through NetGalley.*I read an ARC, and quotes may not be final.\n",

I've lived in Washington my whole life and had never heard of the PCT somehow, and hearing places I've been to multiple times on vacation mentioned as base camps for searchers was wildly interesting. Lankford did a fine job balancing personal experience and opinion, science and statistics, and covering multiple cases progressing around the same time period. I was impressed at her composed discussion of the more colorful aspects of such cases - trail weirdos, facebook trolls, wannabe helpful psychics, and other hikers who chimed in with distracting, false sightings and leads. She also kept it fact-focused, something I found missing in Jon Billman's similar book, The Cold Vanish, where he meandered off about Bigfoot and conspiracy theories.\n",

Oh and she hugs and kisses him, buys him gifts and plans on spending the weekend with him. This is the kind of behavior that would get someone fired or arrested. Never mind the emotional damage of making promises she can’t possibly keep to an already traumatized kid. She has no money, no car, credit card debt and shares an apt with roommates who are just as irresponsible as her. One scene, which was supposed to be funny (but was not) involves her pothead roommate who doesn’t take care of basic hygiene needs. She resents her sister for getting more attention than her when they were kids. Never mind that her sister was severely ill. Grow up, or see a therapist. I know it’s fiction, but this is too much for me and except for the creepy themes, it reads very YA. Does the world really need an adult Willie Wonka? No it does not.

Many reviews have said this is more young adult fare but I didn't find it so. There is magic, romance and a difficult foster-to-adopt situation. Lucy also deals with having a limited income, so she does her job as a teaching assistant and supplements her income with her knitted scarves on Esty. I found those subjects a little too adult for this to be kids' fiction but I think kids could enjoy it too. Parts of this book broke my heart but it is ultimately a joyful story.This was a truly unique book, even though it has remnants of Willy Wonka, but with the kids coming back as adults! I loved the characters, it sucked me in right away and I read it in a couple of sittings making this book perfect for readers young and old.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.\n",

      "In a Nutshell: ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ without the “wonkiness”. [Pun intended.] I loved this book almost till the end. A sweet and beautiful read that will warm the cockles of your heart despite some sappy elements. Story Synopsis:Six years ago came the last book in the long-running Clock Island series. Since then, children’s book author Jack Masterson has stayed reclusive. Until now, when he has announced a brand-new Clock Island book and a special competition, offering the winner a mind-blowing prize.Lucy Hart has always been a huge fan of the Clock Island series and of its author. As a teacher’s aide, the twenty-six year old shares her love of reading with her little charges, especially with seven year old Christopher, an orphaned child who loves his teacher more than anyone else. Lucy dreams of adopting Christopher, but her financial situation doesn’t allow her to fulfil her dream.Masterson’s competition seems like a dream come true, and all Lucy has to do is to win his competition. But as we all know, dreams go hand in hand with perils. The story comes to us in the limited third person perspective of mostly of Lucy and Hugo, Jack’s illustrator.Bookish Yays: smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  Though the story was quite straightforward and almost predictable, it was very tough to keep aside. The plot is a nice combination of emotional and heartwarming.  smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  As readers, what do we most love? Books! And when there are books about books, hallelujah! I simply loved the role books played in this plot, right from alleviating fears to providing imaginary escapes from tough situations to simply spreading joy and laughter. There were even some chapters that were written as “excerpts” from Jack’s Clock Island books. These were the perfect addition to the story. All the bookish elements were a bibliophile’s delight.  smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  While I love the premise of Roald Dahl’s ‘Charlie and the Chocolate factory’, Willy Wonka wasn’t really my favourite character. So imagine a similar premise, where you get a ‘golden ticket’ to Clock Island, and weirdo Wonka is replaced by the masterful maverick Masterson. I simply loved Jack’s character – he was the lynchpin of the plot in so many ways. Because we don’t hear from his character directly, he gets maximum attention from us and just as the children in the book, we hang on to his every word. smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  The remaining characters too were as goody-goody as expected in this plot. Lucy, though a tad too impulsive and impractical, had a heart of gold. Christopher is one of the cutest child characters I have ever read. I wish I could just hop into the book and hug him tight! And what can I say about Hugo Reese! The typical romantic coconut – hard exterior, soft interior. First time ever I saw a lead character with arm tattoos! The secondary characters are mostly cookie-cutter, but a few of them still make their presence felt.  smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  The titular ‘wishing game’ refers to multiple things in the plot, one of which is the game that Lucy and the other three contestants have to play to win Jack’s prize. I enjoyed this game as well, with the riddles adding to the fun element. smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  Through Christopher’s story, we also get a look at the foster care system. Though the author has deliberately focussed only on hopeful elements, the book still offers a touching, albeit somewhat saddening glimpse of a system overloaded with needy children looking for care and love. smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  There are several other dark and depressing themes, but most of these are mentioned in passing, thereby keeping the impact on the lighter side. This works well for the plot because the positive vibes would otherwise have been killed by the sombre elements. smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  Clock Island is not just the name of the book series but also a location. And man, what a location it is! Right from the rooms in the main house to its various clock spots, the whole island seems like the perfect spot to live in. To top it all, the book has a map of the island at the start! smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  While there are hints of attraction in the story, romance never takes centre stage, which remains firmly focussed on the personal development of the characters. This always works to my benefit as I hate insta-attraction stories.Bookish Nays: pensive_face  One particular writing choice towards the end disappointed me. That development simply wasn’t needed, and it felt like a satisfactory track had been purposely manipulated to heighten the emotional shock. Cutting off that part from the book wouldn’t have made any difference, or rather, would have improved the book.  pensive_face  Certain elements in Lucy’s backstory also felt farfetched. Her reason for staying away from certain people wasn’t convincing. The big reveal in her arc reminded me of a Jodi Picoult book—not revealing the name here as it is akin to a spoiler—but it didn’t come across realistically in this story. pensive_face  Just as in the Roald Dahl book, you know who will be the winner. So the proceedings are somewhat guessable. Then again, this genre thrives on a guaranteed HEA, and the HEA is delivered to our satisfaction. But a small part of me wishes it had explored the boundaries of predictability and even gone beyond.All in all, this was one of those books where you know how things will go but you still can't stop reading. The fast pacing also helped. Especially considering that this was a debut work, the author has handled it quite well. For most of the book, I was accompanied by my Shoulder Angel and my Shoulder Devil. Angel was going all gooey-eyed, laughing and crying along with the candy-sweet plot developments while Devil was rolling his (her?) eyes at the improbability of the mushiness and the predictability. Angel and I decided to ignore Devil and relish the read with all our heart. But the final couple of chapters proved Devil correct as the emotional manipulation went a step too far with the introduction of the unnecessary plot point. Thereafter, Devil convinced me to lower my rating to 4 stars even though Angel was comfortably perched on the 4.5 stars mark. 4.25 is a way of keeping them both happy.Recommended to those who would love to read a touching found-family style story with plenty of fun and emotional moments.4.25 stars.My thanks to Random House Publishing Group – Ballantine and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Wishing Game”.

      "How I wish Clock Island existed in the real world, outside the pages of Meg Shaffer’s debut novel, The Wishing Game. I’d be on my way to Maine right about now, just so I could see it with my own eyes. My boys would be in tow; my husband, too … his complaints and all.I grew up loving Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, the original movie starring Gene Wilder, and later also loved Roald Dahl’s classic book upon which the movie is based. Which is why it doesn’t surprise me in the least that I adored Shaffer’s whimsical tale of a magical contest on a fairy tale island and the woman, Lucy, who wants to win the prize more than anything.At its core, the novel is a simple, heartwarming story, one filled with lovable characters and fun riddles and games. There’s some light romance to it, too, and it has loads of feel-good moments involving friendship and found family.But I wanted a touch more from it. Greater depth, richer characterization, and smoother dialogue, especially coming from the secondary characters. Some of the conversations in the story are rather stilted.And is it just me, or does Lucy’s relationship with the child, Christopher, feel a bit odd? Their closeness and how they talked about Lucy being his mom seemed borderline inappropriate, especially in a school setting. I don’t know – perhaps I need to adjust the way I see it.Still, a magical book, The Wishing Game. The nostalgia of it, the coziness of it. It’s like a big bookish hug from your best friend.\n",

      "DNF. Once, just once, I want Hilderbrand to sit down and write a story about the characters right from page one. Not the fancy bread in their fridge or the hydrangea under their kitchen window or the boat shoes on their feet, or their best friend’s sister from college - THE MAIN CHARACTERS, right from the start. Tell a story, because when she does it’s delightful. But for crying out loud, if anyone has read even one or two of her books already we know what Nantucket looks, smells, and sounds like. We know the middle, last, and nicknames of every person on the island. This. Reader. Wants. A. Story.\n",

      "4.25 starsOh my god I can't believe that I basically binged the last half of the book. Early in the book it was putting me into an slump but the audiobook as well as the plot getting interesting got me out of it. This book is a beautiful story of friendship, grief and love that I would recommend. It was so good. The five-star weekend is about Hollis Shaw and her four friends. Hollis seems to have the perfect life. She is the person behind the super popular food blog Hungry with Hollis, and has a doctor husband and a daughter in college who is on her way to becoming a filmmaker. But then her husband Matthew dies in a car accident shortly after having an argument with Hollis. Hollis's entire life changes in an instant. Her daughter Caroline comes back from college for Matthew's funeral but she constantly says cruel things to Hollis, and doesn't care that she's grieving too. For months Hollis has no idea what to do with her life. But then she hears about something called the five-star weekend, which is about a woman who went on a vacation to Nantucket with her four friends from each stage of her life after the death of her husband. Hollis decides to take inspiration from this and to do with four friends from the stages of her own life. These friends that she chooses are Tatum (her high school best friend), Dru-Ann (her best friend from college), Brooke (her mum friend from when Caroline was growing up) and Gigi (a fan from her blog who she's connected to but who's never actually met in real life). But all of these women have problems of their own. Tatum is terrified that she might have breast cancer after finding a lump on her breast, especially because she has a family history of this illness (her mother died from it when she was 18). Dru-Ann is facing a career crisis after a comment she made about her client's mental health goes viral, which even gets her cancelled from her very own successful sports show. Brooke has had enough after her husband and the father of her twins is being sued again for sexual misconduct at work, and is always struggling with her self-confidence. Gigi meanwhile is hiding a huge secret from Hollis-that she is the secret mistress that Matthew during the latter part of their marriage. Meanwhile Hollis manages to convince Caroline to film the five-star weekend for her blog in exchange for some money. Her daughter is happy to come back to Nantucket after ending her love affair with her filmmaker boss, who has a girlfriend. All of the women arrive there and it is not long before tension starts rising to the surface. Tatum and Dru-Ann still hate each other after meeting at Hollis's wedding 25 years ago. Brooke has finally dumped her husband but she still struggles low self-confidence and social awkwardness. Gigi still isn't telling Hollis that her dead husband was having an affair with her, but she's terrified that the truth will come out. Hollis is a little bit suprised by the drama that starts happening but she is hopeful that she can get the five-star weekend back on track. But this might be harder than she thinks it might be and during this time she is reunited with her high school boyfriend Jack Finnegan, who she still has feelings for and it seems that they are definitely reciprocated by him. Though Hollis still doesn't know how she feels about seeing Jack again. I really enjoyed this book. Some of the beginning was a bit slow for me but once I got past that I started getting really into the story, and I got through it a quicker. All of the characters were interesting, even though some of them were really annoying at times (which led me to sometimes kind of hate them lol), and I enjoyed reading their backstories and seeing how that shaped them into the women they are now. There wasn't that much romance but what it did have was sweet and beautiful. I would definitely recommend this book to literary fiction readers or if you just want to read a enjoyable and bingeable beach read.\n",

      "Here’s the thing. Jojo Moyes needs zero of my help selling her books and since I loved Me Before You, Still Me and One Plus One I am not super interested in dissecting all the reasons this one didn’t work for me. Some books just aren’t for some people and for me that has a lot to do with the characters. I didn’t much care for doormat Sam at all and thought Nisha was a real See You Next Tuesday throughout the entire story (even though an attempt was given at providing her a redemption arc). The plot didn’t really tickle my fancy either and it was waaaaaaay too long (especially when things went all “Three’s Company” while attempting to steal back the shoes in the hotel). So that’s that and on to the next.2.5 Stars\n",

      "I was totally transfixed listening to this debut novel!! The audiobook is narrated by Heather Agyepong and her voice perfectly matches the author's words!Maddie is a 25 y/o Black woman who has lived a very “limited” life so far. She is still living in her parents’ home in London since she is caring for her father who has Parkinson’s disease.Although Maddie has gone to University, she was a commuter and didn’t really get that “college life experience”, always having to go to work or come home to care for her dad.She is tired of being the only Black person where she works and knows that she is working at a job that she is over qualified for, it doesn’t help that her boss doesn’t appreciate or listen to Maddie’s suggestions. She just isn’t sure how to move forward!Her mother, who goes to Ghana for a year at a time, finally returns! It is finally time for Maddie to find her own flat and live her own life!!She experiences new friendships with her flatmates who also bring her with them to parties, bars, etc. She experiences first love, first heartbreak and learns that people aren’t always what they appear to be! The author’s bio states that she was born and raised in London to Ghanian parents and studied English Lit at the University of Sheffield.I don’t know how much of Maddie’s real life is evoked in this novel but I think it’s a stunning debut not to be missed!!I received the audiobook from MacMillan audio and the publisher through NetGalley. It was my pleasure to listen to and review this novel.\n",

      "Family can be messy. Maddie is the primary care giver for her father who has Parkinson’s, while her mother resides most of the time in Ghana. Her brother, James resides locally but is not very involved. Maddie also has a job but finds it to be unfulfilling. Her mother is overbearing to say the least. She wants Maddie to date and get married. She also cites bible verses and always seems to know what is best for her daughter, even though she has been absent for a huge portion of her life.Maddie is a people pleaser and does not put herself first. She is mature beyond her years in many ways, and not mature at all in others. When her mother comes back to London, Maddie moves into a flat and experiences living with roommate. Maddie makes a list of things the new Maddie should do and embraces them. Along the way, she has many new experiences - some good; some bad. When Maddie and her family are dealing with horrible news, Maddie must face some \"truths\" and begins to grow in many aspects of her life. Maddie was an interesting character, and I wanted many times to tell her to stand up for herself and be strong. To make her voice known and put her foot down. I felt her brother and mother were constantly asking too much from her yet never really took the time to get to know her. I enjoyed and cheered for her as Maddie began to grow and find her voice and footing.This was a coming-of-age story that looks at culture, family, friendship, responsibility, loyalty, love, and growth. There is also the aspect of the power of a name. Our names are huge part of our identity. Maddie is called Maame from an early age. A name that means woman. She felt the responsibility and power of that name all her life. I found this to be a very interesting part of the story.I enjoyed the second half of the book more than the first part, mainly because I was happy to see change occurring. *Buddy read with Traveling Friends/sistersThank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

      "The Collected Regrets of Clover by Mikki Brammer is a Blend of Family and Women's Fiction!Clover has been faced with death several times in her young life but the death of her grandfather is the one that rocked her world. He was her only living relative when her parents died, he was the one who raised her, and when Clover was on the other side of the world, her grandfather died alone.It's when and why Clover decides to become a death doula. She ensures her clients are not alone during their final days by listening to their regrets and advice, and if they feel like making any confessions, she's there for that, too. She loves being a death doula and views it as an honor and a privilege to serve the dying. When Clover's not busy with a client, she's lost, lonely, and always feels like an outsider. She isolates herself in her apartment for days at a time with her pets and mindlessly watches videos. When she's craving something different, she goes to a death cafe or turns off the lights and uses her binoculars to watch the neighbor couple across the way. Yikes.Then Clover meets a new client named Claudia who's a wise and well-traveled ninety-one-year-old woman with advice, a long held confession, and regrets that triggers Clover to reflect on her own life... The Collected Regrets of Clover has left me with mixed feelings. Clover is sweet, naive, bright, yet so incredibly and painfully lonely I wanted to give her a great big hug. Then I realized she's a thirty-six-year old adult and her behaviors felt YA leaning. This combination didn't work for me. The Collected Regrets of Clover progresses slower than I expected and although I love a slow-burn that allow deep background into characters and backstories, at 60% in, it feels repetitious. At 62% the pace picks up and everything changes but is this shift enough to alter how I felt about this story up to this point?I love The Collected Regrets of Clover from 62% on and the ending was just about perfect but it wasn't enough to change how I felt about the story over all. It's an imaginative story with great characters that grabbed me in the beginning, lost me in middle, then pulled me back in at the end. 3.5 stars rounded down!Thank you to NetGalley, St. Martin's Press, and Mikki Brammer for an ARC of this book.

      "This started really sweet, with Greta, a forty-something transcriber for a sex therapist who lives with a crazy friend in an ancient house without heat, coincidentally meeting one of the people whose sessions she transcribes. She recognizes the person she affectionately calls Big Swiss from her voice and they start an affair, but it seems like it's not doing any good for either of them and they both hide a ton of secrets from each other. Things get very complicated, as expected.I really preferred the first half of this book, mainly because I loved the transcribed therapy sessions, not only with Flavia, but therapist “Om”s other patients too. They were a little crazy and lots spicy. Since I didn't really warm up to the character Flavia, aka Big Swiss, but really liked Greta, the book gradually lost its oomph, but still stayed interesting enough to hold my attention until the end. I'd say it's a fun romp, totally readable during a calm festive day with not much to do. 3,5 rounded up.\n",

      "“Yes, Lewis. Yes. I will marry you.” (This is what I would say to Lewis if I was Wren and I lived inside the pages of Emily Habeck’s debut novel, Shark Heart.)The book opens with one of the most gorgeous marriage proposals I’ve ever read in literature – Lewis to Wren, asking her to spend the rest of her life with him. And after I read it, I was instantly smitten with the writing, the characters, and the unique nature of this love story. How unique is it? It’s this kind of unique: Lewis and Wren are newlyweds when Lewis is diagnosed with a shark mutation, meaning his body will transform into that of a great white shark. This devastates their marriage and destroys their dreams. Together, they’re mourning the crumbling of their union; as individuals, Lewis is losing his teaching career and his dreams of being an actor, while Wren is left to rebuild her life and find new joy. What will her life look like without Lewis in it? Can they still somehow be together, a human and a shark?Habeck’s way of telling the story is fablelike in feel and emotional without being overwrought. And she experiments with style, sometimes slipping into poetry and other times laying out the scenes like a play. The way it all comes together is beautiful.The novel does stumble, though. Halfway through, the story switches from Lewis and Wren to Wren’s mother, telling the mother’s story of neglectful parents and an abusive relationship. It goes on for way too long, takes too much focus off Lewis and Wren, and feels unnecessary. I see the point of it, but the point could’ve been made in a more concise way.But really, Shark Heart is such an impressive and original debut that I can’t even fathom what Habeck will write next. Whatever it is, I’ll be waiting for it.My sincerest appreciation to Emily Habeck, S&S/ Marysue Rucci Books, and NetGalley for the digital review copy. All opinions included herein are my own.\n",

      "Steven Rowley has done it again. He has written a poignant, thoughtful book about friendships and found family, and how important it is to cherish the people you love and to let them know how much you love them. I absolutely adored his book, The Guncle; this book is very different, while still exploring the concept of grief and relationships.The main cast of characters consists of five friends who bonded in college: Marielle, Craig, Naomi and The Jordans (two guys both named Jordan). There were six of them but one died suddenly, just short of graduation and the other five are left to mourn and to pick up the pieces of their lives, as they set forth from their college days. (I found myself jealous of their close relationships, since I didn’t experience anything like this in college.) While they are still reeling from Alex’s death and funeral, they make a pact to get together to provide a living funeral for anyone of them who needs it, at a low point in their lives. We follow the friends through the years, off and on, and join them in their “live” funerals. Do not think this is totally a sad book; there are many very funny parts. Example: the skydiving episode was both particularly affecting and funny.The writing itself was lovely. At first I was intimidated by the length of the majority of the chapters, but Rowley has provided many places within those chapters where it’s easy to stop, should you need to put down the book before you reach the end of that chapter.Steve Rowley is going to be an auto-read for me, from now on - and I look forward to the pleasure of reading his older works while I await his next novel.Thank you to NetGalley and G.P.

      "I was extremely disappointed in this novel for quite a few reasons. First, I like a story to be told in concise chapters that advance the storyline. This book rambles and has no chapters at all. The book which is in excess of 400 pages is divided into 3 sections. It is virtually impossible to follow the rambling endless narrative. Second, the plot if you ca call it that basically is that the good altruistic people are naive and clueless and easily taken in and bamboozled by the billionaires of this world who are always up to no good and who always have everything at their disposal to get their way and ruin society and our planet. Frankly, I'm not sure I needed 400+ pages of prose to tell me that. Third, the story could have been better told if pruned to about 100 pages. Perhaps I was expecting too much from this book since it came highly hyped (I mean compared to MacBeth?) but I don't think it was \"me\" I actually believe this book was the disappointment. Of course there are elements that made it a difficult read for an American reading a story set in New Zealand and written by a native author, but that was only a minor element in my disappointment. And lastly, the book didn't really END...it just rambled off into the sunset.\n",

      "Update: NYT Book Review weekly podcast has a great interview with Catton in which she discusses her motivation in writing this book and a lot of the considerations that went into it.=====================================================================It's difficult to decide where to begin with this review, since author Eleanor Catton gives us plenty to consider. The book features a half dozen well-drawn characters, a plot that builds slowly but at the same time seems inevitable, and acute observations about political and environmental issues. And a setting that is lovingly described: a remote area of the South Island of New Zealand.Birnam Wood is a grass-roots organization raising crops on unused land, with or without the owners' permission. (\"Birnam Wood\" is a location in Macbeth: \"Macbeth shall never vanquished be, until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill shall come against him.\" The significance of this seeming prediction of invincibility echoes through the book in multiple ways.)Three individuals associated with Birnam Wood are key to the story: Mira, the trained horticulturist and passionate founder; Shelley, the detail person, an administrator of sorts; and Tony, an intellectual who left the group years ago but has returned with an updated take on their worldview.The plot kicks off when an earthquake blocks Korowai Pass, the primary access to the community of Thorndike, a large adjacent farm, and a national park. The plans of the owners of the farm, Sir Owen and Lady Darvish, to sell off a significant portion for development were sidelined by this event. In steps Lemoine, an American billionaire, with an offer to purchase the property; he wants to build a bunker as a personal bolthole when global catastrophe hits.Unaware of this, Mira has her own plan. Since Sir Owen and Lady Darvish won't be on site for an extended period, Birnam Wood will use the space to grow crops on a far greater scale than anything they have attempted before. When she travels to Thorndike to assess the situation, she encounters Lemoine and things turn interesting, building to a climax worthy of any thriller.There is a certain coolness in Catton's descriptions of the characters that initially kept me from connecting with them. But as the chapters rolled on and they were revealed in increasing detail (often through self-reflection), I became more and more attached to them, Lady Darvish in particular. The complexities of the plot also emerge slowly, particularly as nothing related to Lemoine can be accepted at face value. Points of view alternate among the six principals, and their awareness, or the lack thereof, of each other's motivations triggers much of the forward momentum.As I think about the book while writing this I am struck by Catton's skill at interweaving the characters' stories and the greater theme of personal responsibility in the face of pending global ecological and political disaster. I keep getting an image of a giant cat's cradle of delicately interwoven strings - can any of them be plucked to resolve the puzzle?After reading this, I'm not surprised that Catton received a Booker for her earlier book The Luminaries, which I haven't read. She is an impressive author.\n",

      "Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton, a thriller mystery novel set in Thorndike, New Zealand and is Shakespearean in its wit, drama, and immersion in character. A brilliantly constructed consideration of intentions, actions, and consequences, it is an unflinching examination of the human impulse to ensure our own survival.Honestly speaking, I was very excited to read this book since it felt very different and of course the authors previous book is a Booker Prize winner. But this one did not match with my reading tastes, what I mean here is the fact that the writing style is very different and felt like I was reading a textbook.The plot is at the same time catchy which kept me going through the book, the book is divided into three different parts, and the first part is almost 120 pages of the book which is the world and culture setting of the entire plot and very very boring.The book two kept me going and was read quite quickly as compared to the first one. Overall, all I would say is it's a good book but just not my preferred choice of read. The suspense between the two main characters was excellent.\n",

      "as a shakespeare lover, i was incredibly excited to read this book from the title alone. the book started off a bit slowly, but there is just something so elegant and sophisticated about catton's writing. moreover, birnam wood's plot feels very careful and deliberately planned—an element i always appreciate in mystery books. while the premise seemed tame, i was pleasantly shocked and surprised at how much i was blown away by the ending.this book is not an easy read—paragraphs are densely packed with monologues and ideological discussions, but the payoff is worth it in my opinion. her writing, like the title of the book, felt very shakespearean in this (especially the characters), focusing on how idealistic yet impulsive decisions can cause a butterfly effect into becoming a fatal flaw. birnam wood perfectly captures the zeitgeist of environmental activism and in the same vein, the exploitation of this environmental activism.while i did eventually love the book and the writing (which was more digestible than i expected it to be), i do wish lemonie had been a bit more of a nuanced villain. i feel like the plot was so well thought out and as a reader that was great to see, but i wish the same energy had been shared for characters as well. the caustic tone and personalities of the characters sometimes felt so caricatured and jarring juxtaposed to the well planned plot.i cannot wait to see what eleanor catton releases next!thank you to fsg for the arc!! <3\n",

      "Now shortlisted for Booker Prize 2023 - This is my winner. Good luck. The story of a family whose members are all on the brink of breakdown. I'm not a fan of novels that change the protagonist every 150 pages, but in this case, I found that every new family member managed to be more interesting than the previous one. Despite apparently very little plot, Paul Murray keeps things moving in the right direction. In the end, I knew this is my new favorite from this year's Booker longlist.\n",

      "I felt underwhelmed by this book. At its core is a story about a couple who’s dissatisfied by their marriage. Somehow, Nathan Hill stretches this basic premise across 600 pages, when I think everything insightful about these two characters could’ve been communicated within 200 pages. I found some of the conflicts within their marriage and some of the flashbacks into their pasts interesting, though a lot of times the prose felt dry or the characterization came across as too try-hard. Hill also includes a lot of commentary about the wellness industry which came across as a bit random to me. I felt like these portions of the book could have been better distilled into a few paragraphs of straightforward critique instead of being interspersed throughout the book. Finally, throughout Wellness he incorporates basic psychological principles in a name-dropping kind of way (e.g., here’s this psychological premise, here’s how this character uses it) which also felt distracting and oddly jammed into these characters’ lives (maybe I was particularly unimpressed because I am a Psychology professor, lol.) Onto the next!\n",

      "The thing about Bryan Washington's novels is that in some ways they are everything I love and in other ways they are not my thing. There's always some tension there, but so far I've finished them both and I suspect I will continue to come back.I love the Houston setting, the way his characters feel like people I know, how unapologetically queer everything is, his thoughtfulness and care with his characters. He really lets us sit in struggle but also lets us soak in love.They are also novels that can feel plotless, that have a fluidity to them, and this is harder for me. I tend to be a plot and momentum person. Novels people call poetic are not really for me and I think Washington falls in that category. But I think it's saying something that most of those novels I do not read but Washington I will finish and finish happily.I found this a lot heavier than Memorial, Cam in particular is one of those people who seems to have encountered so much pain and struggle that it can feel overwhelming. (There is police violence against a Black person that hits pretty hard.) Every character here has a lot they're grappling with and they all come to it in different ways. The three different perspectives here really flesh things out, getting to see TJ from Cam's perspective and then Cam from TJ's perspective really opens things up. This book just feels so lived in. I loved that.\n",

      "Sublime - a beautiful exploration of three women and their deep connection to the natural world and each other.This is a story of strong, unconventional women who discover their power waging their same-but-different battles against the patriarchy (different centuries, same old shit). There are beautiful elements of magic here for those who like that, but they won't be' off-putting for those who don't (these are green witches, not Halloween witches - there are no spells, cauldrons, or black hats). The author beautifully captured the magic of the natural world, and the way it heals, sustains, and gives life. I was surprised to learn that this is the author's debut - the story is so layered and nuanced, and written with a confident hand. The book is well-crafted, with beautiful writing, intricate characters, vivid imagery and symbolism, lovely pacing, and three equally-compelling storylines that unfold and interweave seamlessly. The womens' discoveries of their individual and shared gifts is well done, and each woman's behavior and choices are logical and appropriate for her time, place, and historical context. A triple narrative and triple timeline can be tricky as one character's story is generally more interesting or more thoroughly developed than the others, but there is no weak link here - all three characters and storylines equally compelling.

The narrators were really good, unfortunately the sound quality of my edition wasn’t good (the sound was not clear, as if they were speaking inside of a very small room using an old portable recorder).Hardcover (St. Martin’s Press): 336 pages, divided into 55 chapters.

      "Una novela cautivadora. Me ha gustado mucho. Verghese tiene traducida una obra anterior, que ya está en mi lista de pendientes.Dice la sinopsis:El pacto del agua sigue a una familia que sufre una aflicción en cada generación, al menos una persona muere ahogada, y en Kerala el agua está en todas partes. A principios del siglo XX, una niña de doce años es enviada en barco para contraer matrimonio con un hombre de cuarenta al que no conoce. A partir de entonces, la joven y futura matriarca, conocida como Big Ammachi, será testigo de cambios una historia llena de alegrías, pruebas de amor y lucha ante las adversidades. Evocación de una India desaparecida, imbuida de humor y emoción, El pacto del agua es un himno al entendimiento humano y al progreso de la medicina, y un testimonio de las dificultades sufridas por las generaciones pasadas por el bienestar de quienes viven ahora. Mis impresiones.La novela relata la historia de tres generaciones de una familia hindú, cristianos de Santo Tomás, desde 1900 hasta 1978. Se ambienta en Parambil, Madrás y los Ghats suroccidentales de Travancore.El hilo conductor es Gran Ammachi, que contrae matrimonio a los doce años con un hombre de cuarenta, viudo y con un hijo. La familia con la que emparenta sufre desde hace generaciones de un mal, \"la Condición\", que lleva a aquellos que la heredan a tener muchas probabilidades de morir ahogados. En una zona como Kerala, donde el agua está por todas partes esa probabilidad cristaliza a menudo en muertes. En qué consiste este mal y cómo curarlo se convierte en el gran anhelo de la matriarca, que generación tras generación, le pide a Dios que si no puede curarlos ponga en su camino a alguien que sí pueda. Paralelamente a la historia principal, desarrolla la de Digby, un cirujano escocés, que, discriminado en su país de origen por ser católico, acaba ejerciendo en Madrás. La narración se articula en diez partes. Todas las piezas van a encajar, unas a medida que transcurren los hechos, otras tendremos que esperar hasta el final. Son muchos los temas que se tocan en este libro, la familia, el amor, el sacrificio, las tradiciones, el sistema de castas, la alienación de los leprosos, la medicina, la colonización británica, la discriminación que impuso a la población nativa, la posterior independencia y la evolución de las costumbres.La ambientación, muy buena, es uno de los puntos fuertes. Verghese recrea una atmósfera que es un fresco de lugares y costumbres. Las aldeas, las ciudades, los trenes, los olores, las enfermedades comunes en ese lugar y época, las privaciones y las personas, que a su vez constituyen un mosaico heterogéneo. Los personajes, numerosos, están bien trazados. Entre todos ellos brillan con luz propia Gran Ammachi, Elsie y Mariamma. Tres mujeres muy distintas, pero fundamentales. En torno a ellas se articula la historia. Destaco igualmente, como el autor nos presenta el carácter de aquellos aquejados por la Condición, el marido de Gran Ammachi, Jojo, Philipose, Lenin y Ninam. Con los rasgos de cada uno se construye el mapa del mal que los aqueja, aunque tardarán generaciones en ponerle nombre. El desenlace es correcto. Me ha dejado con ganas de un poco más, pero eso ya es personal y subjetivo.En conclusión, una novela cautivadora, una saga familiar con el telón de fondo de la India del siglo XX. Buenos personajes y bien narrada. Recomendable.\n",

      "In 1469 China, eight year old Tan Yunxian knew she would be married off at fifteen, into an acceptable family, with a husband who matched her sign, the Metal Snake. She'd already been through the binding of her feet which needed to be tended to often, so there was no infection. But her mother was only twenty eight when she died of the serious infection of her feet, and her death caused a drastic change in Yunxian's life. She, along with her servant Poppy, and first concubine Miss Zhao, were sent to Yunxian's grandparent's home, where she'd remain in their care until her marriage, learning to become a doctor like her grandmother. Yunxian made a friend at her grandmother's house, Meiling, who was the same age as she was, and also the daughter of the mid-wife, in training to become one herself. Yunxian's loneliness abated somewhat when she and Meiling played together.After Yunxian's marriage, and the producing of three daughters, her husband took a concubine to give him a son. Yunxian was sent to Beijing to tend to the Empress, a long journey by water, and there she met up with Meiling again, who was to deliver the Empress' child. Both Yunxian and Meiling were also pregnant, both hoping for the arrival of sons. But there was trouble ahead along with tragedy...Lady Tan's Circle Of Women is the 2nd I've read by Lisa See and while her writing is exquisite, I found the book overly long and drawn out. I was shuddering over the binding of feet and what happened if it all went wrong; of pregnancy and birth, and the measures taken to avoid the blood. Yunxian was a stong, determined woman, well ahead of her time in her positive outlook to her patients, in a time when doctors weren't meant to be women!

      "4 stars Thank you to Book Club Favorites at Simon and Schuster for the free copy for review. This book publishes February 7, 2023This is the second book by Sadeqa Johnson that I have read and I believe she just keeps getting better and better. Her development of characters is top notched, her knowledge of the material she writes about is well researched and her style of writing and her use of words makes the story unfold easily and urges you to continue to turn pages. The House of Eve is written in alternating chapters between Ruby, a poor Black girl unwanted by everyone, including her family, and Eleanor, the first Black girl in her family reaching for that college education, and also hindered by her own family. The story takes place in the 1950's against a back drop of racial prejudice as Ruby begins to see a young Jewish boy and Eleanor falls in love with a man well above her own social class. Both girls end up pregnant - Eleanor marries her 'rich' man - against his families wishes, while the younger Ruby is sent to home for unwed mothers, so as not to ruin her chances for a full ride at a local college. In good time the lives of these two girls will cross. That intersection of lives will bring forth not only sacrifice, but love and understanding. Four pages of authors notes give a description of why Johnson wrote this book and what it mean to her and her family. For anyone who has had a child, adopted a child, lost a child, or miscarried a child, this book is written for you.\n",

There were moments of joy and pain and it was all handled with class.

      "3.75 star In I938 Vienna, in the aftermath of Kristallnacht, six-year-old Samuel Adler is sent to England via Kindertransport – his mother’s final gesture of love in a bid to save her son’s life. Samuel, a violin prodigy and the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust spends time in foster care among strangers before finally finding a home with a kindly Quaker couple. We follow Samuel’s story into adulthood, his move to the United States, and his love and talent for music playing an important role in the life he builds for himself.Letitia Cordero was seven years old when everyone in her family, save for her father, lost their lives in the El Mozote massacre of 1981. Letitia and her father fled El Salvador, crossing the Rio Grande to enter America, where they eventually make a life for themselves.In 2019, seven-year-old Anita Diaz and her mother, fleeing from violence in El Salvador, is taken into custody at the US-Mexico border while trying to enter the United States. Detained and ultimately separated from her mother Marisol, Anita, visually impaired after an accident that took the life of her younger sister, is left to fend for herself, shuttled between foster homes, alone and desperate to reunite with her mother. Anita copes with her fears and loneliness through conversations with her deceased sister and dreams of an imaginary magical world where she would be reunited with all of those she has lost. Selena Duran, a social worker attached to the Magnolia Project for Refugees and Immigrants, and Frank Angileri a lawyer from San Francisco who represents Anita’s interests pro bono, work together so that Anita is granted asylum while the search for her mother continues. After Anita endures a particularly traumatizing episode in foster care they manage to track down Anita’s distant relation, Letitia Cordero who is sheltering in place in her employer, the elderly Samuel Adler’s home during the pandemic. As the narrative progresses we follow Anita, Letitia and Samuel as their stories converge - three lives, impacted by similar circumstances, decades apart –– and how they impact and are impacted by one another- on a shared journey of hope and healing.Touching upon themes of forced migration, sacrifice, loss, trauma, healing and found family, the author seamlessly weaves the three threads of this story together to craft a beautiful, heartfelt narrative that will touch your heart. Powerful prose, superb characterizations, fluid narrative, and the author’s masterful storytelling make for a compelling read. The pace is a tad uneven but not so much that it detracts from the reading experience. Though the three characters and their childhood experiences are set in different timelines, decades apart, the author draws out the similarities between historical events and contemporary politics and policies, in the context of the impact of the same on children whose lives are upended in the face of violence and war, forced migration and immigration policies and politics. The author paints a heart-wrenching picture of the plight of innocent children forced to flee their homeland with their fates and their lives in the hands of those who might not always be sympathetic to their cause. This is not a lengthy book (less than 300 pages) but definitely a timely and thought-provoking story. However, I would have liked it if a few aspects and characters in this story had been explored in a bit more depth and the ending did feel a tad rushed. But overall, The Wind Knows My Name by Isabel Allende is an impactful read that I would not hesitate to recommend.Many thanks to Random House-Ballantine and NetGalley for the digital review copy of this beautiful story.

      "If there is one thing Allende will do for me, it’s breaking my heart. I’m not sure what I expected going into this novel, but it was a wonderful, impactful brilliantly told story about the human experience. CW: murder, rape, descriptions of rape, racism, antisemitism, domestic violence, torture, brutal historical events i.e. Kristallnacht and the El Mozote MassacreThe Wind Knows My Name is told across several narratives and time periods. Readers follow main characters Samuel, Laticia, Selena, and Anita through the tragic experiences that they experience as children and their lasting impact on them as adults. Part of this book explores human loss and grief and the other part explores the inhumane policies that prevent people from finding safe havens in places like the United States. While this book is tragic in many ways, it does speak to human resilience and the importance of found family. What Worked: I absolutely adore Allende’s writing. This is the third novel that I’ve read by her and her ability to pull me head first into the pages of her stories never ceases to amaze me. There are also some great explorations of the history of human tragedy in this book. As always, Allende does a great job weaving in real historical events that affect and mold characters throughout the story. In this particular novel, readers learn more about WWII through Samuel’s perspective, the El Mozote massacre through Laticia, and the dangers of human trafficking as well as inhumane border policies through Selena and Anita. While I was unclear of how their stories would connect, Allende did a great job of driving them closer together through the theme of human loss and tragedy. Each has lost something or someone meaningful to them and they spend a great portion of the novel attempting to not only work through their grief, but accept their circumstances. Regardless of the tragedy that they face, Allende doesn’t leave readers or her characters without a sense of hope. The importance of found family and community in this book is the silver lining to everyone’s dark and stormy experiences. Their development as characters is beautiful, yet real. They make mistakes, have regrets, break societal expectations, engage in great acts of betrayal, are betrayed, treated in the most inhumane manner and yet each one of them eventually learns how to trust and love through it all. Allende writes with great emotion and easily exhibits it through the lens of her characters. These are people that will stick with me for a while. Even though they are not real, they represent those who have experienced and continue to experience these things. It makes me reflect on the privilege I’ve had of never dealing with half of the human tragedy that some see every single day. If you’ve never read a book by Allende, I implore you to check something out by her and soon. There isn’t a book by her that I’ve disliked. Overall, this was a solid read and I’m excited to dive into more of her works soon.\n",

      "this book was written after isabel allende researched \"...instances in which children have been separated from their parents...\" and gives historical examples that are likely lesser known, depending on the readership, than what occurred throughout the holocaust or what still occurs at the mexico-u.s. border.it came across as a social issues 101 explainer about kids who survived atrocities, and how they're inherently connected, but without saying anything more than that.everyone was devoid of personality outside of their lived experiences through tragedy and trauma besides their relation to other people who also experienced tragedy and trauma. but in a way that is so detached you never care much about who they are currently.‣ samuel's chapters gradually became my favorite. hated that everyone perceived him to be a rickety emotionless \"invalid\" old man. can we stop with the flippant portrayals of ableism in relation to ageism. i understand that he says this at least once in a frustrated tone towards himself, but it's because it's perpetuated by young people that old people are incapable or lack in self-determination.‣ leticia was literally only here to bridge the gap between characters ‣ hated frank and selena. they spoke to one another and behaved in such an outdated immature way, i couldn't believe their chapters were taking place in 2019/2020. it felt like the first season of sex and the city so you bet your bottom fucking dollar their chapters were cringe as hell. ‣ frank is \"watching his figure,\" makes multiple comments about selena being too curvy/overweight, and is initially only humanized because of his family members. fuck off, frank.‣ selena is supposed to be the modern day nadine which sucks since they're both insufferable when it comes to their interpersonal relationships and communication (or lack thereof)‣ so, i used to work with a blind student. one moment, they're talking about helping anita adapt as a blind person. getting her a brailler, looking into the school for the blind, and giving her a lot of auditory input. the next moment, they want her to get surgery to \"fix\" her vision so she can go to a \"regular\" school. like, what? i thought we agreed she was irreversibly blind? the reason she's blind felt like a cheap plot point to disseminate information. that rubbed me the wrong way. i appreciate that allende consulted experts and researched visual impairments, but, she created an odd dichotomy where she was flip flopping between blindness or no blindness.a book that could have been written by anyone because there was nothing distinct about it.thanks to ballantine books (an imprint of random house group) for this ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n",

      "Reading the synopsis of \"Looking for Jane\" you'd think it's a poignant story about the lives of three women intertwined by adoption, secrets, struggles and a dark, shared history. I think it even actually says that somewhere. As an adopted child myself, I was intrigued and more than ready to relate to and fall in love with every single word. Instead, I actually hated this book. A lot!Initially, I thought I had read a completely different book than everyone else because the mess I read was no 5-star masterpiece. And, quite frankly, I believe the only reason this book has so many glowing reviews is because it covers a very hot-button topic during a very dark period in Canadian history and readers feel that they need to love it. But if you look past the subject matter, you'll see it for what it really is: a badly written, agenda pushing, commercial for abortion rights. Now, just to be clear, I am a woman, an adoptee and a Canadian liberal. I'm as far left as left goes. I am and will always be staunchly pro choice so my review isn't based on some deep seeded, bible-thumping morality that I insist on beating people over the head with. It's based on the fact that this book is 400 pages of some first-timer writer preaching at me and pushing her own personal and political agenda. What's a surefire way to ensure that I won't care about something? Insist that I MUST care about it and then shove it down my throat until I choke on it. Not only is the abortion rights argument so blatant and shoved down your throat, the word \"abortion\" is used no less than a hundred times in a 400 page book. It's shoved into nearly every page and into nearly every conversation regardless as to whether or not it even fits there. The author even includes an Authors Note at the end where she encourages readers to hound politicians, harass the office of the Prime Minister of Canada and \"be the squeaky wheels\" in order to advance abortion and women's rights. And to ensure her point is driven all the way home, the majority of the conversations between the characters are deliberately contrived to reflect the struggle and the unfairness of abortion laws back in the 70s and 80s. \"Oh, how I wish things were different and women had access to safe and legal abortions!\" \"Yes, life would be so much better if abortion was legal!\" \"Why are the men doing this to us???\" \"I don't know! But we need to fight to change things for our daughters and granddaughters so they may access safe and legal abortions!\" \"Yeah, we need to fight for a woman's right to choose!\" \"Let's go protest!!!\" \"Yes, we must if we want to see change because as long as men exist, abortions will be needed!\" I didn't make any of that shit up. All those cheesy, contrived statements appear, in some form or another, multiple times throughout the story. It sounded like the dialogue in a workplace training video. I half expected the characters to all stop, look directly into the camera and the More You Know rainbow to pop up on the screen The author routinely wobbles back and forth between present tense and past tense, sometimes in the same paragraph, which was distracting. She also has trouble deciding if she wants to tell her story in the second or third person narrative. Yes, you read that right, SECOND (not first) and third person. Then, she employs some of the worst, most contrived dialogue ever put to paper, removes all character development, weaves the rest of the story using only coincidences and tops it all off by using every, single adverb in the dictionary, ensuring that none of the cardinal rules of fiction writing are even sort-of respected.If all of that wasn't bad enough, the author then decides to insert a pointless storyline about a \"stereotypical\" married lesbian couple who, naturally, have fertility issues...because of course they do. *insert eyeroll here* Really? That's all your lone gay characters are good for? There's absolutely nothing else for them to do? At all? Their story feels so tacked on and out of place, that it almost seems like she decided on a whim that her novel didn't have enough diversity so she added the couple almost as a side note without giving them a proper storyline. Later on, she pulls a third gay character out of her hat to serve no other purpose than to be Evelyn's beard....or Evelyn is HIS beard. I dunno. Either way both storylines are insulting and stupid. Whatever happened to characters just being regular people?Then, she seems to forget that she spent a hundred pages telling the reader allllllll about what a great, patient, understanding, open guy Nancy's husband Michael is only to have him completely flip out and flush their brand new marriage down the toilet when Nancy tells him about an abortion she had years before she even met him. DAFUQ?And if all that wasn't bad enough, SPOILER ALERT, you find out at the end that the main characters, Evelyn and Nancy, who have known each other for years, are actually mother and daughter.... because we never saw THAT one coming a mile away.  unamused_face  It was WTF enough but later, as Evelyn is telling her story, she talks about how the baby she was forced to give up for adoption looked just like her brother. So, you mean to tell me that she didn't notice after alllllllll that time working side by side that Nancy had a family resemblance? Not once? She didn't share a single look, gesture, tick, habit with Evelyn or her biological father? Fuck straight off!However, the author probably had the foresight to assume that we readers would have figured out the mother/daughter connection ages ago so she does try to fool us with a red herring that could have really gone somewhere had she thought it through. Instead, she uses it to crank up the crazy on her whole book by telling us that teenage Evelyn, following the birth of the baby she didn't even want, nearly murders a nun at the home for wayward girls, attempts suicide, fakes her own death, assumes the identity of another girl who was with her in the home, goes to university, becomes a famous doctor and is actually a totally different character than who we believe she is.......and not a single person ever noticed. Fuck allllll the way off and when you get there, keep fucking off! And she springs this on us out of the blue, at the very end, without ever having even minutely eluded to it and actually expects us to just accept that and not immediately think that Evelyn is a fucking psychopath. Are you sure you jumped all the way over that shark? I could go on all day pointing out all the inconsistencies and nonsense. The author could have written a beautiful story and made her political, abortion / pro choice argument if she had just eased up a bit on the political, abortion / pro choice throttle. Instead, she wrote preachy, agenda pushing feminist junk that we'd do well to just ignore.\n",

      "Go As a River by Shelley Read is a debut novel following the life of Victoria, a woman living on a peach farm in Colorado 1950s.Of the many 5 star reviews this has so far received, I am a bit of an outlier because unfortunately this book didn't land for me. My biggest issue was that the writing style had hardly any dialogue and had a focus on the setting. This is only a problem because of my preference for plenty of dialogue and minimal descriptions of the setting.This story is told in the first person and for me, this didn't work as I found Victoria to be quite dull. There were some one dimensional characters that I think couldve come alive if we'd been given the opportunity to inhabit their perspectives specifically Wilson and Ruby-Alice. Both of these characters exist on the fringes of society and yet they have very little agency in this story which is a shame, because they were the most interesting to me. The inner life of Victoria felt lacking to me, and so her character didn't feel all that real or fleshed out. Often the events of the story are so front of mind for Victoria that space wasn't given for much of her reflections. There is a particular passage where Victoria tells us she is thinking about specific events, but she never actually says what she thinks, which was a missed opportunity. My reading experience with this was not great overall, and because I was frequently bored, I had more time be critical of elements of the book. Having said that, my favourite part was towards the end in a series of letters, which I found very engaging, I just wish this element was introduced earlier and played a bigger role in the book as the middle was very stagnant.I think if you enjoy books that have a strong focus on setting, and appreciate themes of motherhood, isolation and the natural world this would 100% be your cup of tea, but it wasn't mine.CWs for racism including lynching and ableismNote: A copy was sent to me by the publisher to review.\n",

      "“Beautiful, tragic and full of nature” are my best words for this novel set on the Gunnison River in Colorado. It tells the story of Victoria, a young woman who, having lost her mother, lives with her cold, hard father, her evil, jealous brother and her broken, angry uncle. The family lives on, and runs, a renowned peach orchard. In addition to seeing the hard life the men in her family have thrust upon her, we see Victoria’s deep love for the peach farm and the adjacent wilderness of the Gunnison Valley. Victoria falls in love with a Native American, and her brother takes revenge. After her beloved is gone, Victoria finds herself pregnant with his child. She flees deep into the mountain wilderness where she spends most of her pregnancy and delivers her child. The descriptions of all aspects of living off the remote mountain forest - from the growth of seeds planted, to the wildlife, to catching food, to cold and rain, and ultimately to delivery of a baby in the wilderness and near starvation – are as well done as any I have read. Victoria returns alone to the peach farm to find her family gone and that a reservoir will be built which will flood her home and the peach farm – her one mainstay in life. Over a number of years, through personal strength as well as doubt, Victoria survives and finds peace and unification. This book was special for me because I have spent a great deal of time in places which are the setting for this book. I appreciate Ms. Read’s bringing these places to life for others through her novel.\n",

      "The first 20% really impressed me.The writing is gorgeous!And I thought that I was going to love this book based on that.But, unfortunately, the beautiful writing was not enough to keep me interested.The storyline is great, but its development lacked something for me. After a while I found it too slow and repetitive, and I just didn’t want to pick up the book again.For such a small book (76k words) it took me too long to finish it. Several moments I felt like quitting, but I persisted, waiting for that redemption point that would wowed me, but it never came.I read this book because it was chosen by Oprah’s Book Club for the month of October 2023.There are plenty of high praises, so please, do not mind me.This was my second book by this author.“Sing, Unburied, Sing” was a 3 stars for me, in 2017.\n",

      "Salvage the Bones is a story I’ll never forget and again, I’ll continue to read Ward, but aside from her being really good at words, the story here just was not for me. I’m admittedly a giant dumbdumbbaby and accidentally came across the fact this was a reimagining of Dante’s Inferno after I had already finished reading. Being unfamiliar with the original work (aside from name and the principles of “seven levels”) I can only remark on my issues with this one. Mainly, my complaint is the flow was so lacking. The plot jumped from setting to setting without much character development (truly at the beginning I had assumed Annis was a much younger girl . . . until the sex scenes – which, ummmmm, really? I’m no pearl clutcher, but was it really even necessary?) Also, I’m an idiot so I had to double-check myself more than once that Annis and Arese were the same person and not a typo. But more than anything I’ll blame my wrongreading on the fact that I (a) do not enjoy magical realism and (b) am not a spiritual person. And WTF was the all the bee shit? God I am way to stupid to read this!While the ending was satisfactory (especially when it came to the relationship between Annis and Aza), really I think a novel about the swamp and those who managed to escape and live there would have been a much bigger success for me.\n",

      "\"Women these days are doing all kinds of things---\"This is a perfectly serviceable novel. It offers drama and intrigue, tragedy and humor, thrills and sentimental feelings. And, who doesn't love a story about strong female characters who can kick ass when the chips are down? Book clubs will probably love it.But . . . It all felt familiar. Too familiar. Though the addition of the moonshine war was a unique touch, I feel like I've read this book dozens of times. Plucky Gal takes on the world and wins. Yadda, yadda, yadda. This is certainly not a bad book by any means. It just needed some spark to really bring it to life, and set it apart from the dozens of similarly themed books out there.

      "Every once in a while, a book comes along that is so assured and so powerful you can’t believe it’s a debut novel. River Sing Me Home is just such a book. From the opening pages, I was thrust into Rachel’s desperate, dangerous life as a slave on the run in Barbados in the nineteenth century, and I followed her journey to find the children who were taken from her with my heart in my mouth. Eleanor Shearer is a remarkable writer and she brings this story of a mother’s courage to the page with compassion, tenderness and pitch-perfect prose.\n",

      "\"River Sing Me Home\" is a Good Morning America book club selection that had gotten tons of press thanks to a huge marketing push by the publisher. I need to remember to let the hype die down before picking up the book because I'm more often than not disappointed.That is not to say that Eleanor Shearer should not be commended for writing a book that educates us on the injustice & horror of slavery in the Caribbean islands during the 1800's. There are some beautiful passages that I highlighted to save in GR's. However, great novels pull you in and you lose yourself in the emotional journey of the characters. Intellectually, I understood Rachel's pain and emotional journey...but I never felt it. It all felt very surface y to me. (Yes, I know that isn't a real word but it's what I kept thinking as I read.) I don't know why that was...whether I was expecting more due to the hype or if as sometimes happens when I read electronically, there is a disconnect that keeps me from losing myself in the story. Once year's ago, I experienced it for the first time as I read the hardcopy of \"Someone Knows My Name\" (Book of Negros in Canada) by Lawerence Hill...then at lunch at the bookstore I picked up a Nook to continue reading and wondered what had happened to this amazing story. However, once I got back to the book, the depth and beauty of the story reappeared. It was a 5 star (but not if I had only read it on the Nook).So don't let this review stop you from picking up the book and enjoying the story. It just might not have been my day to read this one.\n",

      "3.5 starsI liked how this novel portrayed three generations of complex, flawed, and strong Vietnamese women. Thao Thai highlights the effects of intergenerational trauma as well as how compassion and care can be passed down through families as well. I for the most part also appreciated the portrayal of patriarchy and how Thai highlighted that the different men in this novel either fully participated in sexism and misogyny or did small yet meaningful actions to support the women in their lives.On the more negative side, I felt that the quality of the prose didn’t fully support the ambitious themes of the novel. Sometimes the writing felt dry or the similes or metaphors came across as forced. I also didn’t love the one passage where one of the Vietnamese women basically thinks that a white man thinking of her as fragile or doll-like is similar to her making assumptions about him because he’s a white man; there’s a huge power imbalance between white people making stereotypes about Asian people and Asian people generalizing about white people. I think where Thai left Ann’s character was a smart and empowering choice, though the inclusion of Noah’s character – and the space devoted to him – felt unnecessary.\n",

A fifteen-year-old servant girl escapes Jamestown, for reasons that are revealed slowly, making her way through the Colonial wilderness through grit and a desire to survive. From what I understand, Groff, a writer of extreme intelligence, originally wrote this in iambic pentameter, just for fun.

      "I was decently impressed with Willingham's sophomore effort after being an outlier on her first book (I figured it all out ahead of time), this one at least had a few more surprises on hand. I'm glad because \"missing without a trace\" is my favorite trope if done right, and this one had a good exposition and explanation.Told in two timelines--in the present and in the past. Present day, Isabelle and Ben's young son Mason disappeared from his crib in the middle of the night one year ago. Their marriage has split up and Ben has moved out. Isabelle is obsessed with figuring out what happened to her son. She isn't sleeping at all and she goes to different true crime conventions in the hope that she can get the word out about her son. The past timeline is when Isabelle was growing up, she was a very deep sleepwalker and one night something happened that Isabelle thinks might have been her fault. Was Mason's disappearance her fault as well? I pretty much figured out what happened in the past before it was all revealed, but I was wrong with my guesses about Mason's disappearance and who was responsible. The way that fit together in the end did elevate my rating for this one, despite Willingham's tendency towards overly flowery descriptions and my overall dislike for Isabelle through most of the book. I thought there was WAY too much dwelling on her lack of sleep, sleepwalking, keeping herself awake, being tired, micro sleeps, etc. It almost put me to sleep.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Karissa Vacker, and I'm not the biggest fan of her narration (too much whispering) but I was kept interested and entertained regardless.The book is very fast paced and the reveals to the different parts of the mystery come at regular intervals that allowed me to remain engaged with the story rather than getting bored. I'm glad I gave Willingham another chance and will be interested to see what she comes up with next.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.\n",

      "Publication Date: January 10, 2023It has been almost a year since Isabelle Drake’s toddler son, Mason was taken from his crib in the middle of the night while Isabelle and her husband Ben slept in the next room. Over the last year, Isabelle has been functioning on minimal sleep and has left no stone unturned in trying to find her son – hounding the police who have been unsuccessful in finding any clues, giving interviews and investigating the backgrounds of her friends and neighbors and attendees of the true-crime conferences she attends. Despite her initial reluctance she also agrees to participate in a true-crime podcast hosted by Waylon Spencer, who has been successful in solving a cold case in the past and who was one of the attendees at a conference in which Isabelle speaks about her son’s disappearance. Isabelle's marriage has fallen apart after Mason’s disappearance and her husband Ben has apparently accepted that Mason is never coming home. He has moved on and is now involved with another woman. But nothing has deterred Isabelle from her efforts to find her child. As the narrative progresses we are taken back to Isabelle’s childhood and the traumatic events that have haunted her throughout her life – events for which Isabelle holds herself responsible. We also get to know more about her relationship with her husband Ben – how they met, their marriage, and subsequent events. While Isabelle tries to zero in on possible suspects, often acting impulsively in confronting those whom she suspects, it becomes clear that she is also a suspect in her son’s disappearance in the eyes of the police and others around her. With no one above suspicion and over a year since Mason was taken, will Isabelle be able to figure out what happened on that fateful night? Who took Mason? Is he still alive? Who can she trust to help her? Can she even trust her own memories of that night? All the Dangerous Things by Stacy Willingham is an absorbing read! Suspense and twists, lies and deception, flawed characters and an intriguing well-structured plot make for an engaging psychological thriller. The narrative is shared completely from Isabelle’s PoV and moves back and forth between the present day with flashbacks from her relationship with Ben and chapters devoted to her childhood. I wasn't the biggest fan of Stacy Willingham’s previous novel, A Flicker in the Dark , but I thoroughly enjoyed All the Dangerous Things. Though the pace does wane in parts, I enjoyed the plot development and the twists and turns along the way. Though the primary mystery is that of Mason’s disappearance, a lot is going on in Isabelle’s life and the author seamlessly weaves past events into the primary narrative and expertly brings it all together in the end. The author touches upon themes of trauma, marriage, motherhood and mental health in this story. I won’t say that the end wasn’t entirely unpredictable but I was definitely surprised by how we got there. I look forward to reading more from this author in the future.Many thanks to Stacy Willingham, St. Martin's Press and NetGalley for the eGalley of this engrossing novel. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.\n",

In 2018, Jess gets a call to come home to Australia as her Grandmother is ailing.A series of mysteries enveloping 3 generations. A House with its many secrets whispering to be told. The stunning landscape of the vast lands, red earth, the peculiar animals, the array of fauna and flora. Themes of mother-daughter relationships, postpartum depression, infertility. I wasn’t sure about the structure of this. 2 timelines worked well but then a novel within made me a bit ambivalent. I did adjust- reluctantly.

      "Jess is an Australian who has been living and working in London for twenty years. She’s a journalist but has recently been struggling to hold down a regular job. Jess has also broken up with her boyfriend and consequently can’t really afford the cost of living alone in this city, in the house they once shared. But then she receives a call to advise her that her grandmother has had a fall, back in Sydney. Could a excursion down under give her a chance to clear her head, and perhaps she could even write an article about her trip that she might earn some money from?Once in Australia, Jess starts to unpick a mystery concerning the genesis of her grandmother’s accident and stumbles across a lot of hitherto unknown history surrounding her family, and perhaps even a link to her virtual estrangement from her own mother. It’s a complex tale of connections and relationships in a small community, and at its centre is a tragic event that happened on Christmas Eve in 1959.I listened to an audio version of this book read by actress Claire Foy. She does a great job of alternating between a fairly posh English accent (possibly her own) and a very passable set (to my ears at least) of Aussie accents. It’s a tale that builds slowly and includes fantastic descriptions of Australian settings. But readers/listeners will have to be patient as it all takes quite some time to come to the boil. But when it does it provides as satisfying an unravelling of the facts as I’ve come across in quite some time. In truth, this is not really the kind of story that normally takes my fancy: requiring more concentration than I ordinarily have to spare, as inputs arrive from a variety of sources regarding a large cast of characters. However, here it’s all so well executed that any nagging doubts I might have had were shuffled to the back of my mind as I became drawn ever deeper into this intriguing tale. It’s my first experience of a novel by this writer, but on this evidence it’s unlikely to be my last.

      "I truly can not fathom how so many people have rated this book 5 stars. Perhaps part of the issue I took with this book is that I was under the impression that it was a murder mystery, when at its heart it seemed to be more about mother daughter relationships. If you think, well I’m more interested in familial relationships than murder mysteries, you will still be let down. This book doesn’t deliver on either side. The most glaringly obvious issue with this book is that it does a very stark and middling impression of Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood”. A good part of the book is our main character Jess moving from one room to the next reading a true crime book about the murders of her family members. I do not take issue with a book having excerpts from another book included, but entire chapters were devoted to the fictional book in a way that made me wonder what book I was truly reading. If the author wanted to simply badly rewrite In Cold Blood, she could’ve done so elsewhere. The similarities are so barely changed from the inspiration that I will just list them here:-an entire family murdered -in 1959 -in a large, sprawling house/estate -within a small town -in a rural area -where nothing like this has happened before or since -the mother has dealt with mental health issues -the teen daughter is dating a young local boy who lives nearby -the father is often away on business -the mother is obsessed with miniatures -the mother gives a miniature object to a young local girl the day before the murders -the book is written by a journalist -in the style of “New Journalism” where the author applies fiction methods of storytelling to hard fact to write a more robust story -the book is a best seller I literally picked up In Cold Blood to read after Homecoming because I wanted to read an actually well written murder mystery and had been meaning to read it for a while. I was only 30 pages in when I was floored by the glaringly obvious similarities/rip offs of the true story. Please just read In Cold Blood instead, I promise it will be more worth your time. The mother-daughter relationship just didn’t go ANYWHERE. We find out that Nora has been incredibly manipulative and quietly terrible to Polly (and the entire town) her whole life, but Jess is never in a position where this comes to light for her. We are left on the note that Nora was still loving and a great person even though the facts of her actions tell us otherwise. She was a true villain and digging into that would’ve been interesting and satisfying but the author seemed to believe Nora’s own narrative and didn’t get there. We have the entire story of why Polly left Jess in the first place (aka Nora’s manipulation) but at the end of the book Jess is none the wiser and still thinks her mom left her just because. It was incredibly frustrating to have that information as a reader and for the main character to just not find out. The twist of who killed the family is very convoluted, barely makes sense, and is completely unsatisfying. The switching of perspectives, especially at the very end where we get Polly’s side, is sloppy and seems to come just because the author couldn’t figure out a better/more cohesive way for us to get this information. But again it would’ve been much more satisfying to get it as Jess herself figured it out or is told by Polly instead of the author just telling us on the side. Finally, the characters might seem fleshed out because the book is 544 pages, but upon thinking about it for more than a minute you will find that they are all very one dimensional. If you’ve read this far, you know my suggestion is to skip this book  woman_shrugging_light_skin_tone \n",

      "Let me start by saying that Rebecca Makkai is one of my literary goddesses. Her previous book, The Great Believers and the exquisite story collection, Music for Wartime, have a prized and permanent position on my bookshelf.The first thing is that it’s important for readers to put those books – and others this author has written – out of their minds. This is a different kind of book, a psychological suspense book and a deep dive into collective memory, racial, gender, class-based schisms, and an abysmal justice system – all of which define and sometimes even destroy us. At first, I didn’t like it until I did, and when I did, I was all in. The story centers around Bodie Kane, a not-so-privileged teenager who ends up in a privileged New Hampshire boarding school. Bodie has had tough breaks: two deaths in her immediate family, excess weight, and an inability to fit in and banter like her roommate. That roommate is Thalia, a popular and attractive girl who has a boyfriend, Robbie, and is also bordering on an inappropriate relationship with a young, married teacher (who is addressed as “you” throughout the book). And then she is found dead in the swimming pool. A Black man is accused.All this is set up quickly. The bulk of the novel focuses on the adult Bodie, now successful, attractive, but damaged podcaster, who is called back to the boarding school for two weeks to teach a small group of students. She is plunged back into these pivotal high school years, this time with an ability to question the validity of collective memory, including her own.At first, my fear was that the premise would be too reductive. There is a lot of time spent setting the scene and restating what an insular and privileged place Granby Hall (the boarding school) is and introducing a host of student names. A sometime-love relationship Bodie is involved in seems underdeveloped. I shouldn’t have been a doubter. When this book ignites, it becomes unputdownable.Rebecca Makkai tackles issues that are prevalent then and now: patterns of violence against women who are verbally and physically attacked (along with referrals to true-life stories: “the one where her body was never found…the one where he left her body for dead under the tarp.”)She takes on an over-zealous #MeToo movement as well as concerns about objectifying and obsessing about violent deaths, particularly if the victim is attractive. Most victims are “young, as we prefer our sacrificial lambs.” The rush to judgement , the insidiousness of misogyny, the untethered power of Twitter and other social media sources that shape opinions without asking us to ferret out the facts. The ending is nuanced and organic.\n",

      "Outlier review here, even though I am giving ALL THE SINNERS BLEED a three-star rating. I didn’t think that it was a terrible novel, but I don’t agree with the majority of my Goodreads friends who gave it a high five-star rating. Nor with Stephen King, who gave it a glowing review in the New York Times—and usually I agree with Mr. King’s assessments. Most of the time. ﻿This book excelled in only one aspect, at describing a small, narrow-minded town in the Deep South—Charon—where race still determined social status—a caste system—that slowly, very slowly, is crumbling as the 21st century progresses. Titus Crown, a Black man, has been elected sheriff. He was formerly an FBI agent who returned to his home town to help his father, who is recovering from a hip replacement. When the old racist sheriff died, Titus won the election over the old Sheriff’s equally racist son by gaining support from the town’s Black residents (more that 50% of its inhabitants) plus its more enlightened white newcomers. The author’s description of the town and its ambiance are well done.But ALL THE SINNERS BLEED falls down in several respects:(1) There are too many characters who are named but not described. The only ones I could pick out of the crowd were: Titus, his father (Albert), his brother (Marquis), his current girlfriend (Darlene), his ex-girlfriend (Kellie), Carla (Titus’s chief deputy), Scott Cunningham (the “boss” racist), Mrs. Cunningham (Scott’s mother), and Elias Hillington (the snake preacher)—plus the principal, Jeff Spearman, and Latrell Macdonald who are killed at the beginning of the novel.(2) All the women in the story are stereotypes, and we know very little about any of them except re their relationship to Titus. I’m not even sure about Carla’s race. She is referred to as a “J. Lo” in one sentence, which suggests that she may be Latino. Yet nothing is said about a Latino community in Charon; the white community and the black community are the only two that appear to exist in that town.(3) There was no rational reason for why Dayane Carter, who knew the identity of “The Last Wolf”, wouldn’t reveal it to the Sheriff’s office. Given that the Lone Wolf had recently murdered her lover, she must have known she was in danger.(4) Although in the end, we discover the reason for the Lone Wolf’s killing spree, there is no rational reason given for why Jeff Spearman and Latrell Macdonald joined him in his terrifying deeds. It was completely out of character for these two men to have been involved in torture and murder. When one mulls over this, it was a plot device that simply didn’t work.(5) The Lone Wolf’s real identity is not revealed until the last few pages of the book. But he never appears earlier in the novel. This is a definite no-no in a mystery. The culprit should always appear early in the story, even if he will not be identified until near the end. Thus, ALL THE SINNERS BLEED cannot be classified as a mystery. I suppose it might be classified as a thriller, but it lacks the momentum of a true thriller wherein the protagonist slowly puts together the clues needed to determine the killer. (6) Titus is tortured night and day by his memories of Red DeCrain, yet when the story about Red is finally revealed, I, for one, couldn’t see why Titus was so distraught. DeCrain got what he deserved; Titus shouldn’t have been so upset about his actions in the midst of the horrific incident.(7) Early in the novel, there are suggestions that Titus has OCD, but this thread is dropped as the story progresses. There are several other threads that seem to go nowhere—the drug dealers that are involved with one of Titus’s deputies, Titus’s friendship with Latrell’s father, Elizabeth Morehood’s embezzlement—all mentioned and then dropped.(8) Titus’s memories of his mother loom large throughout the novel. She died of scleroderma, a disease that I had never heard of, and so I googled it. It is extremely rare and seldom kills although it is very painful. I do think the author overstepped himself by using it as a plot device. Just as he overstepped himself by having Titus say pretentious quotes from famous authors throughout the book. It was simply showing off his knowledge of a broad range of readings.I don’t like the author’s writing style, but this may be a personal preference; I think it is too pretentious—far too many “wise” quotes from various sources. Still, given all the lapses in logic found throughout the storyline, I can’t see why ALL THE SINNERS BLEED has received so many high reviews. I think C.A. Cosby has been overhyped, pushed into the limelight too soon—before learning to hone his craft.Thanks to the Greater Victoria Public Library for providing me with an ebook copy of this book to read.\n",

      "This is the author's first adult novel and it still reads very YA. This will be a positive for fans of the genre, but I struggled.Three eleven-year-old girls spend all their time together in the woods playing and exploring. The fun ended when one of the girls survived a brutal stabbing. A serial killer was convicted of the crime, but now there is a question if the wrong man was put behind bars due to false testimony from the girls.  A lot of time is spent exploring the girls' lives when they were young, and the imaginary world where they played the \"Goddess\" game. This is where my eyes glazed over. As adults in the current timeline there is a lot of angsty drama and the girls doing stupid things. YA is not my genre.

      "This book spun me around like a top. So many twists and turns that left me breathless by the end. Naomi is our narrator and is quite prickly. As we learn more about her story, it is easy to understand why. She has baggage. A survivor of a serial killer attack at the age of eleven, she now finds that the death of the convicted murderer has stirred things up twenty years later. There were three girls in the woods that day. All three were united in their story. They also shared a secret. Letting that piece of information out is like the opening of Pandora's box. Who will survive? What will Naomi have to do to get to the truth of that day in the woods? Dark and atmospheric, this book will worm its way into your dreams and make you a little afraid to go for a walk in the woods.Thank you to Macmillan Audio, Flat Iron Books, and NetGalley for an audio ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n",

      "I’m officially joined to fan girls who devour everything Freida McFadden releases including her post it notes with shopping list! I’m ashamed myself for not creating extra time to binge read Housemaid series that might be about drown in my piling up to-be-read list. As a honest confession this is my first book of the author but I can guarantee it won’t be the last! ( I still plan to sleep less and read more till my contact lenses destroy themselves for diving into her previous works)  But let’s put her popular books and previous works aside to discuss “Co-worker”: fast pacing, grey cell destroyer, mind number, nail biter, nerve bender, scream shouter thriller you may possibly read in one sitting till you cannot feel your legs and head gets hurt! The unreliable characterization makes you guess till the end: which woman tells the truth, which one is the villanelle or both of them are angel and there’s someone sinister targeting them.  The big twist that revealing at the end of part one was obvious from the beginning but the second and third ones revealing at end of part three and epilogue were very well executed. The plot revolves around two polar opposite coworkers who share cubicles next to each other. Natalie Farrell : a golden girl of sales team, with her Margot Robbie’s Barbie appearance like shiny beautiful blonde hair, blue eyes, stylish clothes, genuine, friendly manners and Dawn Schiff: strange, shy, possibly on spectrum young woman, social inept, detail oriented accountant, obsessed in turtles, wearing shapeless clothes two sized big for her, in shapeless haircut and tortoiseshell glasses giving nerdish meets weird vibes.  Dawn is always punctual, schedules everything in her daily life including color of her food she eats, bathroom and lunch breaks. But her coworker Nathalie realizes she’s not at her cubicle in this morning which is unusual before she leaves her a message that they have to discuss important issue. She also sends the same message to their boss who is already sick of Dawn’s antics. But Natalie gets more worried at each minute after she answers an office call hearing Dawn whimpering to help her, then abruptly ends the call. Natalie gets intrigued, deciding to stop by Dawn’s place to make sure she’s okay but when she intrudes the place: finding the door unlocked, seeing the horrible view in the living room makes her scream! Did something happen to Dawn? What Nathalie gets herself into?As we read the correspondences between Dawn and her only friend Mia for last six months, Dawn draws a very horrific portrait of Natalie who keeps bullying her at workspace and who might have motive to get hurt. When we read from Natalie’s POV who might be close to crush down from the walls coming up on her, she seems like a flawed person with high ambitions and wrong and instant choices. She keeps insisting she was nice to Dawn. Was she really? Could she have violent tendencies and not so innocent as she seems? What about poor Dawn who suffered enough? Which part should we believe: emails of Dawn or Natalie’s POV? You have to get copy to find out!The romance part of the book was a little agitating especially the climax part where big revelations come out but the ending was satisfying even though it had small plot holes, needing more explanations. Overall: I just couldn’t put it down and enjoy the wild ride even though both characters are not much engaging. Riveting pacing, mind games, representation of cerebral palsy, bullying, suicide, on the spectrum is thought provoking approach to these sensitive issues. I cannot wait to go blind and read more works of the author in near future.Many thanks to NetGalley and Poisoned Pen Press for sharing this unputdownable thriller’s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter\n",

      "Freida has once again delivered an incredibly binge-worthy and fast-paced read in her latest book. True to her style, she skillfully lured me into a false sense of security with a seemingly predictable plot, only to blindside me with a major twist. It's this ability to keep readers on their toes that sets Freida apart.One of the standout aspects of the story was the portrayal of Dawn with autism. I think many readers will either like or dislike her character. In my instance I did find her likeable enough.There was one minor issue that slightly detracted from the overall enjoyment. The recurring mention of \"turtles\" became a bit excessive, and by the time Chapter 5 rolled around, I found myself growing weary of it. Freida certainly ensured that turtles would forever be associated with this book in my mind. Nevertheless, this minor gripe did not overshadow the strengths of the storyline.In terms of the writing style, I must admit that it differed somewhat from her previous works, and there were moments when I didn't particularly resonate with it. Despite this, I still found myself engrossed in the story, largely due to the engaging storyline.This book definitely too me on an emotional rollercoaster, expertly weaving a gripping psychological thriller. The pace never lets up, and kept me captivated from beginning to end. And speaking of the ending, it was an unexpected twist that left me in awe. The narration on this book was not the best and voice came over monotonous at times, but still gripped me enough to continue. In conclusion, Freida's latest book is a must-read for fans of psychological thrillers who crave an exhilarating ride. While the abundance of turtle references and the occasional issue with the writing style may have dampened my experience slightly, the strength of the plot and the skillful characterization make up for it. Prepare to be enthralled by this suspenseful tale that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew.Thank you Netgalley and Dreamscape Media for the opportunity to listen and review this ARC.\n",

      "4.5 star On the surface, Happiness Falls by Angie Kim revolves around the disappearance of a fifty-five-year-old man and the events that follow as both his family and local law enforcement try to locate him and piece together the events that led to his disappearance and the impact these efforts have on his immediate family. Adam disappeared while on a walk to a local park with his fourteen-year-old son, Eugene, the only witness to what transpired. Eugene is autistic and nonverbal, having been diagnosed with mosaic Angelman syndrome (AS). His family is protective of him and initially hides the fact that he was found running on the road in a disheveled, agitated state with bloodstains on his clothes from the police. The events are narrated from the perspective of Adam’s twenty-year-old daughter, Mia. The narrative follows Mia, her twin John, and their mother Hannah over the weeks following Adam’s disappearance as they search for him and take care of Eugene. Mia is intense and does not mince her words when talking about her Korean-American family. She shares significant episodes from her childhood, her dynamic with different members of her family, her feelings about her father’s disappearance, and the facts that are subsequently unearthed in much detail. From Adam’s notes, found in his belongings, Mia finds his research on quantifying happiness, the “Happiness Quotient,\" and his analysis on the same, drawing on events from their lives. It is also evident that Adam had been keeping secrets, some of which Eugene might know about. The narrative follows Adam’s family as they try to decode what Eugene might know, not fully able to comprehend Eugene’s frustrations with his family’s assumptions about his ability to express his thoughts and feelings. Her father’s notes prompt Mia to take stock of her own life, her family dynamic, and how she relates to Eugene both as a sibling and as a human being. Part family drama, part literary mystery Happiness Falls by Angie Kim is an exceptionally well-written work of fiction. The author excels at portraying complex characters, emotions and sensitive family dynamics. The meticulous research that the author devoted to characterizing Eugene shines through. The depiction of a teenager who is neurodivergent and his dynamic with each member of his family is both profoundly moving and thought-provoking. The novel explores themes of family, trauma and healing, the importance of giving each other space and respect within the family unit, human connection, communication and kindness, bias and inclusivity, among others. The pacing of this novel is on the slower side, and the writing is detailed and descriptive. You need to approach this novel with more than a bit of patience, but overall, I found this to be an immensely satisfying read. The brilliantly penned Author’s Note truly enriches the overall reading experience. While I did enjoy the deep dive into behavioral psychology and philosophy complete with researched facts, analysis and Adam’s proposed hypotheses, I felt that it did become a bit too heavy for a work of fiction.This was my first time reading this author, and I look forward to exploring more of her work.Many thanks to Random House Publishing Group and NetGalley for the digital review copy.

      "WHAT HAPPENED TO ADAM PARSON?  Is he alive or dead?!It started out as an ordinary morning. Adam and his Special Needs son, Eugene, had breakfast and then left for a walk in a nearby park. But, only Eugene returns, running home frantically in a way he has never run before, with blood under his fingernails. He pushes past his sister Mia-knocking her to the ground as he runs by her. Mia, doesn’t call the Police right away. There must be a logical answer for this behavior and for her brother returning home alone, but since her brother is non-verbal and cannot explain what happened-she will wait for her father to return and enlighten her. He would never leave his son to fend for himself. as the combined diagnosis of Autism and Angelman Syndrome would prevent Eugene from being able to ask for help. But when the Police come to the door with more questions than answers, and Adam’s disappearance stretches late into the night, Mia, along with her twin brother, John and their Mother must join forces to protect Eugene, and figure out what happened at the Park. The only witness, the agitated youngest child of their tight knit family, is unable to provide the answers they seek. Complicating matters, the Covid Pandemic and quarantine.Narrated in the first person POV of Mia, there is a lot of foreshadowing, and introspection.Like with her debut, Miracle Creek, the brilliant Angie Kim has done meticulous research to enlighten us on Autism and Angelman Syndrome. The story is fiction but based on real life experiences and the family dynamics felt authentic.But, be prepared!! It is HEAVY on SCIENCE and PHILOSOPHY and it also discusses how people quantify HAPPINESS using different experiments and examples. I don’t mind a SLOW BURN, but at 25% I was looking up how many pages were left, because I couldn’t believe I had only gotten that far. It took me twice as long to read this as other books because it is so complex and I didn’t want to miss anything that could be important.I WAS intrigued enough to want to learn the truth BUT, admittedly, I WAS ALSO frustrated by how long it was taking me to get there!!Because this book isn’t a light read, it probably won’t be for everyone. However, it is an impressive work of literature, and I have come away enlightened, so despite the slower pace, I feel compelled to give it 4 stars.

      "\"Things are not always what they seem...\" ~ Phaedrus, PLATO\n",
      "Adam Parson and his fourteen-year-old son, Eugene go for a planned walk to a local park along the Potomac River. Eugene eventually makes it home. His father does not. Eugene has Angelman Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that prevents him from speaking. He doesn't run either, yet his twenty-year-old sister, Mia witnesses him running, then shoves her aside as he continues to run past her and into their house.Where is Adam and why is there blood on Eugene's clothing? Eugene is the only one with the answers to the many questions that arise. Unfortunately, he can't speak... Happiness Falls is so much more than a family's search for their missing husband/father. Angie Kim takes a microscopic look at the dynamics of this Korean-American family, examining all of its pieces and parts.Happiness Falls is a compelling read with the same beautiful writing style, sensitive subject matter, well-developed characters, and immersive backstory found in her debut novel, Miracle Creek. This author does Family Fiction mixed with Mystery-Suspense so well; the research, the trickle of twists, and 'the dangling carrots' that keep the reader hungry for more. And the drama, there's that, too.Happiness Falls is definitely a slower read with the many footnotes and side-notes from Mia's first-person narration leading us through the story. Although tempted, I didn't skip any for fear of missing key points. On reflection, reading all of them wasn't necessary and great editing would have helped trim-the-fat here and elsewhere, so to speak. Mia's narration felt pleasantly 'cockeyed' as she tended to be a bit of a wanderlust. I wanted her to get back on-point and I eventually craved an alternate point-of-view with less intensity, one that didn't leave me feeling so dang exhausted. Perhaps Mia's twin brother, John would have given some 'happy' relief here.Despite the last two paragraphs, and here I go again talking out of both sides of my face, I'm glad I read this book for the great storytelling, interesting characters, and details that made me smarter and more aware. I'm glad my book-lessons are over for now, I look forward to this author's next novel, and I definitely recommend Happiness Falls! 3.75 star rounded up!Thank you to NetGalley, Random House Publishing Group/Hogarth, and Angie Kim for an ARC of this book.

      "A central character in Happiness Falls is 14-year-old Eugene. He has a dual diagnosis of autism and Angelman syndrome, “which means he can’t talk, has motor difficulties, and…has an unusually happy demeanor with frequent smiles and laughter.”When Eugene returns home alone on a summer morning in 2020 from a hike with his dad near the Potomac River, the mystery begins: What happened to Adam Parson, who seemingly vanished into thin air from a suburban Virginia park?While that question propels the novel, it is so much more than just a mystery—it’s a labyrinth of familial secrets and philosophical musings. Author Angie Kim explores the relativity of happiness; Noam Chomsky’s theory of psycholinguistic nativism; the rudiments of speech therapy; and, above all, the pervasive mislabeling and misunderstanding of neurodivergent people.Interestingly, Kim’s first novel, Miracle Creek, also put an autistic character at the center of the plot.In Eugene’s case, his family treats him similar to a nonverbal toddler. His lessons are like a preschool program and he spends a lot of time watching cartoons on his iPad.Narrating this novel is his 20-year-old sister, Mia, who in contrast to Eugene, has a flair for language fueled by a wide-ranging intellect. A college student who’s moved home during the Covid pandemic, Mia may be neurotypical, but she’s hardly typical. A caustic polymath powerhouse, Mia’s brain is always working at full throttle, she dissects every aspect of life, and includes her scientific, philosophic, and musical ponderings in a stream-of-consciousness style. In fact, much like her honors thesis, Mia uses footnotes to supplement her story. Her relentless analysis — she will often shift into what she refers to as “Vulcan mode” (yep, she’s a huge Trekkie) — might annoy some readers, but I appreciated the way her perspective was written. It always felt grounded in Mia’s reality and stayed very in character for who she is; a testament to Kim’s storytelling genius.Mia’s hyper-analysis of everything is how she makes sense of the fact that their father not only disappeared but apparently had been keeping secrets from them. To what degree? That’s all part of the mystery.I should also mention that Mia has a fraternal twin, John, different from her in every way — looks, personality, beliefs. In their attempt to figure out what happened to dad, they really have to try to connect with one another and learn to communicate with each other.Happiness Falls covers so many topics — language, family, communication, the pandemic, racism — all with the backdrop of a missing person’s case. The mystery, however, ends up not being the focal point but a means to understand what Eugene has been experiencing his entire life: his lack of fluency in spoken English is automatically equated with lack of intelligence.Kim’s second novel is a cautionary tale of our reliance on communication to inform intelligence, thereby stripping non-verbal individuals of their humanity and making assumptions about their cognitive abilities. Her afterword about the inspiration behind the book is quite moving. Angie Kim has proven herself to be a masterful storyteller, balancing the mystery here with the family dynamics. Each chapter reveals just enough to keep us guessing.This is a hard read but an important one that will stick with you for some time. Full of mystery, drama, and philosophical musings, Happiness Falls is a beacon of originality.\n",

      "I’ve been waiting for another book by this author ever since I read Miracle Creek, so I was ecstatic when I saw Happiness Falls available on Netgalley. I’m happy to report this release was just as riveting as her debut. Like Miracle Creek, this book focuses on a character that has autism but also Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic condition. It discusses many themes, including language, communication, disability, ableism, and happiness - often through a philosophical lens. I’ve been in a bit of a reading slump recently, and this book managed to pull me out of it. Angie Kim knows how to hook her readers and keep them engaged. It’s a tense read with lots of foreshadowing, making it hard to put down. I’m excited to see what the author publishes next.

      "There's a thin red line between good and bad. Bad things happen to good people, forcing them to do bad things. Would we act the same way if we were in their shoes? The queen of twists, Alice in Writerland, has once again crafted a puzzling, gritty, and enigmatic mystery. With each layer of the story that unfolds, you find yourself asking more questions and forming theories about the mysterious relationships between the four main characters.  There's Edith, a quick-witted, sharp, sarcastic yet endearing elderly woman in a care home, who might just become your favorite character. Then there's Patience, a young girl with many hidden skeletons in her closet, including her true identity. She works as a caretaker but might also be a liar and a thief. Frankie, a librarian in prison, is a woman in her mid-thirties searching for her missing daughter and trying to redeem herself from her dark past. Finally, there's Clio, a psychiatrist living unhappily in a pink house, harboring intense resentment toward her mother, Edith, and even giving away her dog. These four women find themselves connected in some way, drawn into a tricky, dangerous, and deadly situation that results in two murders, three suspects, and one victim. A young, hipster-styled, pink-haired constable digs into their dirty secrets and complex bonds. Will she uncover the truth behind the story's enigmatic villain? What if there are no clear distinctions between good and bad in this tale? What if everything blurs into a gray zone where black and white cease to exist? This book impressively delves into how the decisions people make shape their lives and explores the complex, excruciating, and tough job of being a mother. It approaches the peculiar, unhealthy, and dysfunctional relationship dynamics between mothers and daughters. As someone who has carried mother issues throughout her life, I found myself both smiling at lines in this book that hit close to home and cringing at others that hit too close to the nerve. I easily connected with the characters and their constant battles with their inner demons, their questionable actions, and their righteous virtues. The emotional depth of the book and the author's realistic portrayal of mother-daughter bonds overshadow the murder mystery and whodunit aspects. And, of course, let's not forget that Ms. Feeney pulled the rug out from under me with her last unexpected, jaw-dropping twist that had me exclaiming, \"Oh, sh*t!\" much too loudly. I thought I had assembled the puzzle perfectly, only to realize I had placed the biggest piece in the wrong spot (I know it might sound like gibberish, but you'll understand when you read the last twist). Overall, as a devoted fan of the author, I am in awe of the well-developed narrative and how everything wraps up in the most intelligent way an author can achieve. I'm rounding up my 4.5 stars to 5 and eagerly looking forward to getting lost in more of Alice in Writerland's worlds very soon!Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter\n",

Or at least an average one. I find the writing a bit lost here and there. There are multiple POVs or so it seems (you have to experience it) where the characters all sound similar regardless their age and gender.

It involves two murders, three suspects and one victim. This book sensitively portrays the stages of grief and the agonizing journey a mother embarks upon after losing her child. It also skillfully unravels the intricate complexities of mother-daughter relationships, offering a poignant and relatable exploration of these emotional bonds.I honestly had little too much expectations with this but i was so badly dissapointed. As good as the blurb sounds this book is nothing like that for sure. I thought it would be some kind of sad, mysterious read but i guessed the plot at like 100 page or something and after that i was just skimming through it. The chapters were pretty short but it doesn't really mean that the book was as enjoyable as i thought it would.I like Alice Feeney's writing as she always make all the characters questionable and the plot always had me in a chokehold but this book was just not it for me. Alice Feeney writes stories that make your heart race and your mind twist. She's great at creating suspense and surprises. Her writing makes you feel like you're right there with the characters, experiencing their fears and secrets. It's like a roller-coaster of emotions and surprises, and you won't want to stop reading.The characters in the book often came across as delusional and lacking depth, leaving me feeling disconnected from their narratives. Many seemed irrelevant and failed to engage my interest. While Alice Feeney's use of unreliable narrators has been intriguing in the past, in this instance, it left me wanting more reliability and depth in the characters' perspectives.This book would've been lot better if it started on a good note honestly it started out slow and i hoped that it would somehow elevate but it didn't, it was just soo leisurely-paced. And as i said that i guessed the plot twist at 100 something pages so it was really hard for me to even continue the book. Although that little twist in the end was an unforeseen shocker and that might be the reason i kind of loved it. It was something I didn't really expected. The book often felt repetitive, with Alice Feeney using the same tactics repeatedly to confuse readers, but it became tedious over time.Overall, if you're seeking a book with occasional plot twists, a generous serving of complicated family drama, and a dash of sheer idiocy, then look no further—this book has your peculiar tastes covered.\n",

      "Someone in your house wants you dead.Is that \"someone\" your angry, bitter, and estranged stepdaughter, who recently invited herself into your home to meet her new baby stepsister?Or is it someone else?This twisty domestic thriller with an ultra-compelling premise featured strong characterizations and staggering twists and turns.Unfortunately, my eyes really started to roll at the end of the book. In other words, the final \"staggering\" twists required a HUGE suspension of disbelief and were waaaay too staggering to be realistic.Also, I felt that some portions of the book were overwritten. The audiobook (9 hours, 45 minutes) easily could have been a 7-hour audiobook. If so, I would have upped my star rating.The audiobook was read by Penelope Rawlins, one of my favorite UK narrators.

      "Jacob is a stunningly amazing protagonist.first half of this story rocked my world 10/10 amazing no notes. the letters were phenomenal, their banter made me smile, the representation of jacob’s anxiety and briana’s sweetness toward him brought a tear to my eye and everything was perfect until we got into cyclical internal monologuing for hundreds of pages “there’s no way she likes me it’s fake” “there’s no way he likes me it’s a rebound”. then the miscommunication dragged…and then a new conflict was introduced/new parts of a tragic backstory were unlocked with only 40 pages left in the novel. the pacing was severely off, and things got repetitive, but the characters were lovable and it was compulsively readable with many heartwarming moments so I’d read another from the author in the future. Just very frustrated with the overall execution of this romance because I was so sure it would be my next five star read but it is what it is. some characters need therapy more than they need a fake dating plotline but what do I know.\n",

      "Yours truly was not a fan of \"Yours Truly.\"While Abby Jimenez's \"Part of Your World\" sizzled and soared, \"Yours Truly, Part of Your World #2\" lacked luster and fell flat.It was a rom-com without the \"com\". Missing was Abby Jimenez's signature witty banter, compelling dialogue, and expert pacing.Overall, the book was a dizzying and exhausting read with waaay too much melodrama.The male protagonist had an anxiety disorder and the female protagonist had severe abandonment issues. Both had been blindsided in their previous long-term relationships.As a result, both kept on vacillating and overthinking their relationship. And after both protagonists ceased overthinking, they started overthinking their relationship AGAIN. (UGH!)Mentions of Alexis and Daniel from \"Part of Your World\" in the book were a treat, but even Alexis and Daniel could not save this book.I struggled to finish the book but was grateful that I did because my very, very favorite part of the book was the author's heartfelt note that appeared after the last chapter. To avoid spoilers, I will refrain from commenting on the author's message.I listened to the full-cast audiobook book and both narrators did a fine job with the narration.\"Part of Your World #1\" was a 10-star read. \"Yours Truly\", unfortunately, was truly a disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were set too high?2.5 stars.\n",

      "There were some things I liked about Yours Truly, but overall, the experience was a disappointment. I felt SO betrayed by the fact that this book started off with two of my favorite tropes (fake dating + epistolary) just to slap me in the face with two of my MOST HATED tropes in the second half (tropes, major spoilers): HUGE miscommunication AND lack of communication + ACCIDENTAL PREGNANCY that leads to (plot, major spoilers): ONE OF THE WORST DRAMA-INDUCED FREAKOUTS I'VE EVER SEEN by the FMC.  weary_face  By the way, that last trope? (Major spoiler) by the end of the book, we have FOUR characters who are pregnant: Alexis, Jacob's ex, Nick's wife, and Briana. Not all are accidental or anything, and Alexis made sense. But three NEW ones in one book felt mind-boggling to not have this be in the blurb or something.LOOK, first off, the best thing about this book -- similarly to POFW -- is that I LOVED Jacob as a MMC. I truly do. I felt that Abby definitely explored his anxiety really well here in both Briana and Jacob's POVs. He gets amazing vulnerable moments and is so loveable and loving, just as Briana states multiple times. I loved that Briana understood how to be there for him from the get-go, and that they had a pretty cute initial build up with the initial friendship/romance with the epistolary romance vibes of letter exchanging! The second thing that I loved was that when things went to the fake dating, the progression felt pretty natural. Yes, the circumstances were a bit iffy in terms of the why, but I still believed in Briana's reasonings, and Jacob's made sense to me as well. Things started to take an initial turn when the comfy \"this is easy\" vibes that I was getting from the couple in first half of the book kind of stayed too singular-noted. By the time we get to the \"is this real?\" part, I really didn't really feel it.Which then made everything in the second half go down hill.  loudly_crying_face  It makes sense for there to be some miscommunication, particularly in fake dating as there obviously needs to be the \"is this real or not?\" type of thoughts by the characters. There was just WAY too much here for my tastes. On top of that, both Briana and Jacob describe how things are different with each other compared to their respective exes in their POVs SO OFTEN that it just kind of got really repetitive.And dear god, the third act??? The third act was such a mess.  loudly_crying_face  I could sympathize somewhat with Briana's trajectory because it is realistic to have the kinds of thoughts she had with the history she had, but at the same time it almost quite literally undid EVERYTHING that she had gone through in the whole book that it completely baffled me. Abby also seemed to throw in some plot points for the sake of plot that just made things worse. Major spoilers: Briana specifically spends the whole book learning to trust Jacob, realizing how different he is than other guys in her past. I get she's stressed out and freaking out about the pregnancy, but then why was that a plot point in the first place? It felt so forced, and I hate when motherhood is forced on a character for the sake of plot. Why would they have unprotected sex if she wasn't wanting to get serious with anyone, or why didn't they have that conversation? Why wouldn't Jacob have told her that she was the one earlier after saying it in his dialogue like 2-3 times? On top of that, her freaking out about Nick also came out of left field to me along with the new information about a past miscarriage. I get he was in her life for a long time, but again, she spent the whole time seeing how Jacob could be trustworthy, he literally has her go through his phone, changes his passcode to be the same as hers. And then for her to say that because he's a guy, he's \"just like the rest of them?\" WHAT THE FUCK?  weary_face  I get so tired of the sexism in romances where characters talk about how guys are just all the same or how there aren't any \"good guys\" out there. I'm all for feminism, but it's just so baffling when the MMC has proven to her time and time again how he's an amazing person, how devoted he was to her so why did HE need to grovel? All he wanted was just to love her and have her stay and learned to deal with his anxiety better by his interactions with her her. She's the one who needed to step up and ask for his forgiveness for pushing him away and comparing him to obviously horrible guys. I get that Abby was trying to also have Briana get over her fears, but I felt that it was just too big of a reaction + a HUGE ask as well that felt out of character for both Briana and Jacob. So in the end, first half was great, second half was a hot mess that ruined everything and just pissed me off.  grinning_squinting_face \n",

      "Don’t mind me just updating with more accurate ratings  eyes I anticipate a lot of readers enjoying this book, certainly if the current 5 star reviews are any indication. This book is a romance, but given the author and style, it's being billed more as a literary romance, which is a tricky (non) genre. The main character, Sally Milz, is a successful writer on a fictionalized version of SNL, where, when the novel opens, the show is about to be hosted by an aging but extremely handsome and successful male musician (let's say an older Harry Styles - I know we can't make every fictional musician Harry Styles...but at the same time...can't we though?). What follows for over 40% of the book is an extremely detailed look at the week leading up to the weekly performance, and when I say the detail is painstaking, I mean PAINSTAKING. We learn every part of this process, we walk through it, we hear about every skit. We hear about skits that don't make it on the show. We hear about past skits, relevant bits, and we meet a lot of the staff. Of course, over this week, Sally and our host, Noah, meet and hit it off, Sally impressing Noah with her humor and capability, Noah impressing Sally with his charm and likability (and hotness let's just be honest).While this section was perhaps a BIT too indulgent and detailed (especially because this is a blatant ripoff of an existing TV show, so at a certain point, the cultural recognition should kick in and perhaps eliminate some of the extraneous details here), I did enjoy reading it. I read this section largely in one day, so while I have some criticisms (did we really learn much about Noah beyond \"he's hot and charming? No. Do we really witness Sally being humorous at all? No), I found the character dynamics likable enough, the situations just awkward or human enough to be interesting. At this point I was considering this a solid 4 star read. Then the second section happened. And for 20% of this book, I read through pages and pages (and PAGES AND PAGES) of emails between adults. I mean...not like the cute little emails sometimes used in romance novel plot devices. I am talking 10 paragraph emails responding back to side notes in the previous email, point-by-point playback of where they stand on each individual issue (some of this was admittedly charming; some of it was incredibly cringe and perhaps a bit forced and performative regarding a few social issues). I honestly wanted this to end on every single page. I almost skipped ahead to see when it would, and worried that if it didn't, I would have to DNF. I found it incredibly hard to buy chemistry via email in such lengthy and over-detailed fashion, particularly when the characters hadn't had much interaction before this. I also was just pretty bored.By the time the characters actually meet up again, it becomes clear why these emails were needed (and not just for the obvious plot reason given, as I assume that could have been altered if needed quite easily. Rather I assume the emails were chosen as a way to get the characters back in contact, and then the plot reason was given afterward). These two don't really seem to discuss much. When they're together, while there are physical moments in the book, the actual on page chemistry is largely missing. I felt ultimately just a bit disappointed that I had read up to this point for so little payoff and such a rushed ending, even though it was fine in terms of how it played out.I do want to note just briefly: one of my biggest struggles with this book was the character of Sally. We're in her head, and she's certainly our sympathetic viewpoint character. I liked her descriptions of her part in her show, and I bought why she would be interested in Noah. I also understood the point of exploring her insecurities (not a perfect model, size 2 woman, dating an internationally recognized sex symbol), but WOW I got sick of the way their conflicts played out. I personally did not find it feminist, unique, or \"literary\" to watch a woman have the exact same issue at start, middle, and end of novel with being with a man, primarily her own insecurities. There are more details of how this played out that bothered me that I will skip for the sake of time, but while I think feelings of insecurity are certainly relatable, I ultimately just found these characters largely flat and two-dimensional, and a large part of it was the insane way that these insecurities and the ensuing conflict became perhaps the centerpiece of their relationship. I read this book two days ago and truthfully can't remember much else. Finally, I want to say up front I doubt any of what I'm about to say is Sittenfeld's fault or intention, but I think it's worth mentioning in my review of this book for other romance readers, and this is super preachy/soapbox Hillary, so feel free to skip:I'm very very open to literary romances, or literary \"romantic\" books without traditional HEAs (not my implication either way with this book). I am a big fan of Sally Rooney, and I take no issue with playing with tropes or writing books that perhaps feel like genre crossover. At the same time, I won't lie: when I see a bunch of reviews saying \"I don't read much romance, but I loved this because it wasn't cheesy,\" I do get really wary. Not because we shouldn't allow books to push genre boundaries or follow formulas or writing styles we don't expect, but because I'm suspicious of books that are branded and marketed as \"not like other romances\" where the push is to set them apart as their own superior brand, and where many many early reviews are not from traditional romance readers. In this case, I have to say this worked against the book for me. I expected extremely elevated character dynamics and writing. I expected a story that played deeply with human emotions. I am not sure this book delivered on those expectations. I am not sure it was originally intended to, but that is sometimes what happens when \"traditional romance\" is branded as cheesy, and certain books are marketed as being somewhat above it. Again...not Sittenfeld's fault, and not something that should necessarily impact your enjoyment of the book, but it is something that bothers me. I've read many great traditional romances with character depth, sparkling dialogue, and deep emotional centers.Anyway, ultimately Sittenfeld is a strong writer, and the TV part of this book is really fun in a lot of ways. I think many will love this book. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype for me.\n",

      "\"Universal truths in butter. Secrets folded into the dough. Poetry in the spices. Romance in a chocolate. Love in a lemon pie.\"4 stars  dizzy this felt like both a hug and a gut punch. i've never read a book that was so adorable and yet heartbreaking. i adore the unique time slip concept, with clementine seven years in iwan's future, him seven years in her past. this concept of traveling in time gave the book a beautiful nostalgic vibe, of longing for something that has already gone. i can't even imagine falling in love with someone who quite literally lives in my past. iwan and clementine's relationship was heart-wrenching. slowburn, with witty banter, so much passion.the portrayal of grief is stunningly written, i was impressed with Ashley Poston's writing. of course, dealing with the loss of someone so close to you (in this case it was clementine's aunt) is incredibly difficult and different for everyone. i think Poston wrote the highs and lows and obstacles and messiness of it all very well. it was beautiful how the reader got to see clementine heal through the support of the other characters in the book, i loved it.speaking of the other characters, i absolutely adored the supporting cast. this book isn't just clementine and iwan, it's fiona and drew and juliette and aunt analea. despite aunt analea having passed in this book, she's such a prominent character because she was so important to clementine. i saw someone mention that analea and clementine are right where you left me coded, and that's so so so accurate. analea might be my favorite character, with her adventurous spirit, who was so ready to travel the world, see new things, and live life to the fullest. i think the thing i loved the most was how fleshed out the characters were. Poston isn't afraid to give her characters flaws, and that's SO good because it makes them feel so much more human. each person we meet in this book has such an alive personality, and that makes me care about them as if they were my own close friends, which is beautiful. this book was so raw and authentic and full of feelings.remember to chase the moon ;)\"𝙏𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙚, 𝙬𝙖𝙨𝙣’𝙩 𝙞𝙩??

      "This book takes place at summer camp, where the main characters, Russ and Aurora, find themselves as camp counselors after having a one night stand at a college party. They thought they would never see each other again and then they both show up to be counselors at the summer camp and they realized the other person is there. It's like fate brought them back together in this exciting and unexpected way!  camping  sparkles  I loved that this was set at summer camp. It really does add a fun and exciting element to the romance. I felt there was no plot... But vibes were great. Hannah Grace portrays the concept of found family so well in this book. And it's great that some characters from the first book make appearances.I love how they learn to lean on each other/ become more open about personal things about their own lives it makes the the story that more realistic.Russ was such a sweet and relatable character. It's great to see him grow and work on his confidence throughout the book. I'm sure many readers will relate to his journey and find it endearing two_hearts  .Aurora recklessness was relatable due to her upbringing. I just wanted to give her a big hug people_hugging .

It was a realistic romance about two people who met at the wrong time and had to find themselves before finding their way back to each other. And I loved that. Love is messy and imperfect and sometimes I wanted to scream at the characters. But I also really understood them and appreciated their flaws. And the summer vibes are immaculate.

AND because of the stuff will put her through…i literally wouldn’t have forgave him, nor would it have been me chasing after him and fighting for a relationship…like girl loudly_crying_face honestly i can’t even be mad at the characters…this book was just written poorly. i liked fern and will at age 22 in the beginning, but then at 32, it just wasn’t it. during those 9 years after being stood up at the lake…i would’ve forgotten all about that man tbh lmao so it just didn’t make sense to me. yes their connection was strong, but that was literally it and they never talked either after that one day. it was giving november 9th by coho and when i tell you guys i have no idea why i rated that book 5 stars!?!? pls…when i have time i will be going through all of my old ratings/reviews and fixing them. but yeah this book was kinda giving november 9th except he didn’t show up a year later on the same day…he was 9 years late. fern definitely deserved better, but she’s crazy for holding onto him for so long. “he kept positioning himself so that he was on the street side of the sidewalk.”i feel like this right here is my entire reasoning for giving this book 2 stars (uh yeah the rule is still cute, but um 1 star). see!! will at 22 had me swooning in this moment ok weary_face why did he have to disappoint me. this is literally my favorite thing…ladies if your man or your guy friend is not doing this while you’re walking on a sidewalk…EDUCATE THEM. especially if he’s your guy friend, this will literally get a girl to fold instantly. simple things like this, that’s it! face_with_hand_over_mouth  face_with_hand_over_mouth i liked that will cooked for fern, but this is age 32 will so if there’s ONE thing i like about that version of him…it’s that. “for the record, i can’t dance for shit,” i said the fifth time i trampled his foot.he ran his hands down my back and along my sides, resting them on my hips. “you’re perfect.” face_with_hand_over_mouth  butterfly wait let me rant again for a second. idk why carley fortune wrote that they both were in a relationship at the time they met each other because it just didn’t feel that way. i found it a bit disrespectful, but it’s hard to recognize that they were both in a relationship when carley didn’t make it a big deal. no one cheated and neither of their significant others got hurt, but it was just annoying because it kept me from fully enjoying their moments. so idk. carley needs to stop with the cheating trope and the almost cheating trope, someone’s gotta tell her lmao because isn’t this her second book ever!?! but uh yeah will at 22 was a nice gentleman :) there was some spice in this book. i’m about to start cackling.- “i’ve got a very long list of things i want to do to you, to do with you.” he says, his voice rough.and then this man sucks her fingers. BAHAHAHA. idk maybe this could’ve been hot if carley knew how to write spice. i mean it wasn’t all terrible…just that specific part sent me and yeah it pretty much went all downhill after that so it makes sense. before i wrap this review up i wanna briefly talk about fern’s mom and her diary. i loved her diary entries tbh. and omg i love peter and how he was a father figure to fern. peter and fern’s mom were endgame pleading_face so sad about her tragic accident. i honestly don’t think i recommend reading this book loudly_crying_face i always hate saying that about any book because i feel bad, but ugh it was just disappointing! like it’ll have you going in the beginning, but you’ll most likely just hate the ending like i did. i don’t know if i’d read another book by carley fortune again…every summer after was good, but idk why i rated it 5 stars…all i remember is there was a cheating trope enraged_face i pretty much bought this book because of the cover…i need to stop doing that ._. it’s a toxic trait of mine melting_face i’m sorry if i offended anyone who liked this book pleading_face totally okay for people to like/love it! it just was not for me weary_face although i don’t recommend, please don’t let that stop you from reading this book and forming your own opinion!! heart_hands_medium-light_skin_tone old updates :LMAOOOOO NOW IT’S A 1 STAR cuz f this book :Dhahahahahaha not me changing it to 2 stars last minute because i’m just terribly annoyed and will probably forget this book immediately face_with_tears_of_joy a bit of rant review to come…i thought this was gonna be 4 stars guys…the last few chapters honestly ruined it.here we goooo. i’m going in with low expectations :D i’ve heard a lot of mixed reviews. i liked every summer after…i think? i rated it 5 stars but that was the old me hahaha. new me is picky when it comes to romance now face_with_hand_over_mouth  face_with_hand_over_mouth \n",

      "THOUGHTS:- The first 200 pages of this book are really slow. It's a fun read to go back and forth with the character's memories to create that second-chance romance atmosphere.. but I think this went on for too long without revealing anything. - The secrets that were built up felt like a relief when finally spilled -- and kind of happened all at once. The difference between when this happens in thrillers and in romance novels is that in thrillers, I'm really watching for the crazy to drop and it's almost like people watching from wherever I'm cuddled up reading. In romances... this long of a wait annoys me and doesn't provide a fun 'search' I guess? - The best part of this book to me was the mom's relationship with Peter... I think that's a truer form of love than what I experienced between the seemingly lackluster relationship between the main couple.. and that's a number for any romance novel. - There is cheating involved - however, it's more in that youthful no one knows what they're doing way rather than a hardcore adult way.. idk if that makes sense, but it will if you decide to read.

      "This is hands down my new favorite Christina Lauren book!! A MUST read for all romance fans and the perfect sequel to The Soulmate Equation. What I LOVED:1. The Premise! A successful romance writer is casted as the lead in a reality dating TV show and falls for the show’s producer. What could be better?!!2. Fizzy! I loved her in The Soulmate Equation as a supporting character but she made an even better main character. Her sex-positivity, bluntness, and humor made her so likable and there was something special about watching her find joy in a place where she least expected to. 3. Connor! I know I say this after many romance books but he is now my book boyfriend. I loved how sincere, caring, open and honest he was. The way he fell for Fizzy and appreciated her for her was perfection. Plus, he’s British… and tall. 4. The FLIRTING! Seriously this book has the BEST banter and there were so many times I was full on laughing out loud. The added element of forbidden love and forced proximity while filming made all the angst and tension shine. 5. The single parent trope! Connor is a single parent, which is a favorite trope of mine because I always love when romances add kids to their stories.6. All the Jess/River! I was surprised by how big of a role Jess and River, and even Jude, played in this book. CL did a great job refreshing you on all the small details from The Soulmate Equation too, so I didn’t feel lost in the beginning, especially because DNADuo was tied into the reality show. 7. All the pop culture references!!! Yes, Harry Styles got mentioned twice :)8. The grand gesture! It was perfect and while it easy to predict how the story would play out, it didn’t take away from the enjoyment whatsoever. Thank you SOO much Gallery Books for the ARC! This one comes out May 16th and is so worth it :)!!\n",

      "Definitely better than When in Rome, by a lot. From the first paragraph, I could tell this will be a good one.  check_mark  Bodyguard MMC x Flower shop owner FMC check_mark  Fake relationship  check_mark  He teaches her how to date check_mark  She reads pirate smut  check_mark  He wants to reenact those scenes with her  eyes  check_mark  1.5/5  hot_pepper  Annie,  is a flower shop owner and I found her to be so charming, relatable and humorous. But there's one thing she is not good at- dating. In comes,  Will  who is Amelia's bodyguard  with tattoos  eyes  . Will is sexy, confident and clearly has trust issues. But if there's someone he adores- it's Annie. Upon agreeing to help her practice her dating abilities, the two never realised that there could be something more. From the moment I first read Will and Annie talk, their chemistry was sizzling and came across as genuine. Their conversations are so fun. The two, especially Annie are hilarious. But as I reached the 60% mark, I thought the two denying their feelings for each other despite having open communication was dragging unnecessarily, which is why I rate it 4 stars instead of four. Overall, it's pretty cute. Both characters have more to themselves compared to Amelia and Noah. Would recommend if you're in the mood for something cute and lighthearted.\n",

      "This wasn't exactly how I expected my first read in ten days to go but wow this certainly is not encouraging me to try harder to get out of this slump. And no, I don't blame my slump for these feelings. This was just not it.And I'll admit, the only thing that had me requesting this was some early buzzed about hype so maybe that's not me. Often times, the hype is a monster and it cannot be trusted.I just wasn't interested, or sympathetic, or amused, by either character. Supporting cast didn't delight, either. I was constantly being frustrated by Ari and cringing over Josh's desperation and that is not a recipe for a good time.Normally I might have more to say about a book I disliked and had to actively push through (mostly because I couldn't let this drag on and put me in a whole different kid of slump) but honestly I just have nothing else to contribute. Would I read Goldbeck again? This was their debut so while I'm not going to definitively say no.. I'm also not saying yes.** I received an ARC from NetGalley and the publisher (thank you!) in exchange for an honest review. **---This review can also be found at A Take From Two Cities.\n",

      "Did not finish. I’d like to know if I’m actually reading the same book as everyone else. This is the worst piece of literature I’ve read in a long while. I got to chapter 8. Couldn’t go any further.First off, the endless use of the F bomb is tacky and lazy if you ask me. So many great descriptive words and all this author can do is spout curse words. Curse words do not a personality make. Neither is being a horny 13 year old. Violet is supposed to be 20 years old, but it seems more like she is 12. I mean… “the scar that marks his eye brow only makes him hotter. Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-in-trouble-and-you-like-it-level-hot…” Who talks like that? I’ll tell you. Tweens. I think I’m rooting for the other side of this conflict too. What kind of battle strategy is it to encourage the deaths of dozens of people as an entrance exam? Then to be okay with it when your cadets at killing each other. Let’s just kill off a huge percentage of our able bodied young men and woman every year. Yup. Sound strategy. The big bad school is so scary! It’s incredibly cliche, predictable, and trite in all the worst ways. Violets only personality trait is that she’s SuPeR FaSt aNd SmArT. And the reason her mother tossed her into the school in the first place is super unbelievable. It’s just a weak book with weak and convenient reasons to push the plot forward.\n",

      "Well, well, well. This was interesting. I have a lot of things to say. This was both better and worse than I expected. This could have been at least 800 pages shorter. So much bullshit and filler content. Also, the first half was incredibly boring and nothing happened. The pacing was horrible and it kept dragging.It had so many useless povs. I firmly believe that only the Vegas and Heirs deserved their povs. I don't care about all the other random and irritating povs. They were even more povs than before. I hate Xavier's povs so much. I don't care about his awesome threesomes. Just please stop. Don't add more povs and I can't take it. Well, tbh nothing much happened. There was no plot. Things only happened during the last 80%. Tory firmly carried this book on her back. She was the best character here. She was the only one who had a sense of urgency. She was making things happen. I liked her character arc a lot. She is kind of an anti-heroine and I like that. I hope her character is gonna take a dark turn in the next book. She must pay for the actions. I enjoyed her friendship with Caleb. But otherwise, she was very alone in this book.Though I liked Tory a lot, frankly, there were still some scenes in which she was quite annoying. Also, I surprisingly missed Darius a lot. I missed his stupid and snarky personality. I was very glad to have him back. Darcy's character arc wasn't that enjoyable in comparison to Tory's. She acted weirdly and was very out of character at times. This is the first book where I felt Darcy and Tory's bond weaken.They were separated throughout this book and Darcy also kinda unintentionally abandoned Tory. By the end, Tory has shut out Darcy. I don't like change at all. They barely interacted throughout this book. Orion was as good as ever. I liked the character development of the other heirs. Also, Geraldine was so annoying. Her povs gave me a serious headache. She needs to stop talking so damn much. Also, Lionel is a terrible villain. Not in a good way. He is such a weak villain. He has no personality or motivations except wanting power. I have no idea how they haven't defeated him yet. Why is there a new villain? The previous villain hasn't been defeated yet. So why? They should have ended with this book. Why keep dragging this series? Remove all the filler and you could easily fit a second book here and end the series.\n",

      "4.25 star  This has been a big Romantasy year for me. I have been introduced to hot Faerie men with Bat Wings, morally grey Shadow Daddies, 7-foot Blue aliens with horns and tails...and now 8-foot green trolls with tusks (Trollis if we are being PC :). Suffice it to say, that my horizons have been broadened. The Hanging City is such a unique fantasy story. I went in blind, so finding out it was about a troll city (Cagmar) that is suspended between a canyon below a bridge was so intriguing (reference the provided picture in the book for a better visual, it helped a lot). The idea of humans and trolls coexisting would never cross my mind. The human main female character, Lark, had such a sad history. She escaped her abusive father when she was very young and just wanted to find somewhere she could be accepted. This is one of the first books in a long time that kept me awake until 2 AM so I could finish it. My heart was racing and I was so anxious to see how it would come together. A few moments towards the end with a couple of characters kinda disappointed me...but I did love this incredibly unique story of strength, friendship, and a little Trollis love.\n",

      "Rating: 4 StarsI'll be real honest... I thought I was a bit crazy to pick a book in the Romantasy category to start my 2024 off with. I love Fantasy, but I am not a huge fan of romance, and I was worried this one would be smutty.It was not! I mean... there's a love story. And some closed-ish door stuff. But this book was much more about the adventure and worldbuilding and childhood trauma as it was about the love story. So while I was invested in the romance, I really appreciate that I got the fantasy side first.And boy did we get the fantasy side of things. This book took a while to set up, and wrapping up the book felt like sliding down a hill fast. The first half of the book felt like nothing really happened, and the last half of the book had me checking to see if it had a sequel because there's no way they could fit everything in. They did! It was great! But it was a bit of whiplash.All that said, I do not like trolls. Like... as a trope, they are not sexy to me. Harry Potter and the troll boogies completely ruined that. So while I really enjoyed the story and the love interest and the adventure and the monsters, I was just a little bit repulsed by the trollis. That, and the bit of the rushed ending, took the star off. But really, really solid first read of the year.\n",

      "I'm so disappointed this isn't a 5-star read for me, but her time with Kolis DRAGGED. The first 15%? Fucking awesome. The last 40%? Fucking epic. The middle 45%? Was the same formula on repeat. I need to make him trust me > have a \"deep\" conversation with him that is an excuse for an info dump > he does something atrocious > repeat. This got old really fast and I found myself pushing myself to keep reading to get out of this part of the book. I think her capture could have been half as long and still pungent and emotional and progressive to the story. It's no wonder she couldn't fit everything into 1 book and has had to split into another book. And now that there will be a 4th book, what the actual fuck will be happening? Ash and Sera can probably lay waste to whoever they want at this point, so Kolis couldn't possibly be any kind of threat to them. I guess we'll see...But even though the middle dragged, I still enjoyed Sera's emotional struggle and her progression into understanding what she's capable of and what she's allowed to feel. And JLA writes tense and actions scenes so well they're cinematic. Very similar to SJM's writing though JLA has much more fluff than SJM. SJM's writing I think is much more deliberate. AND WHAT IS THIS LINE TOWARD THE END? For if they rose, they did so as blood and bone, the ruin and the wrath of that once great beginning.IS THIS A CROSSOVER!?\n",

Now, Lis works for Claude. Disguised as a courtesan, she uses her abilities to feel people's intentions and even hear their thoughts at times, and she reports to Claude what she discovers. When her intuition leads her to save a Hyborn noble in the middle of the night, Lis is shocked to recognize \"her\" Hyborn, the one who helped her when she was a young orphan so many years ago. Lis feels an unexplainable attraction to him, but she knows that any association with a Hyborn will only lead to trouble for her, especially if he discovers her abilities. With the Hyborn requesting her as his companion, the hints of rebellion in the air, and the monsters attacking the Baron's estate, Lis must rely on her gifts now more than ever, but it might not be enough to save her and those she loves.I really enjoyed the first 40% or so of the book, but after that, the middle part dragged on a little. The conversations felt repetitive, and nothing really relevant happened until the last 15%. All things considered, not much happened in this book, even though it is over 400 pages long. It feels more like a very long prequel for the real action and politics that will (hopefully) be in the next book.The world building and layout are a little confusing initially, even with the map, but I imagine we will get used to the terms, as we did in FBAA. Still, here is a recap of the different groups mentioned:-\tLowborn: good old regular humans.- Hyhborn: higher class of the population, kind of like nobility I imagine.- Deminyens: Top class of Hyhborn, they are ageless and have elemental and/or mind powers.- Caelestia: mortal descended from the joining of a lowborn and a Hyhborn- Rae: Lowborn who has had his soul seized by a Hyhborn, it’s like a kind of human puppet I think…- King Euros rules over the kingdom of Caelum, and some princes and princesses rule over the 6 territories within Caelum.Lis has special powers, such as being able to sometimes hear people's thoughts or catch glimpses of the future. She also has a very strong intuition, and she learned to listen to it. Lis is interesting I guess, but I struggled to connect with her. Also, for someone with such a strong intuition, and someone who is fairly intelligent, she was pretty clueless at times…Many little things about her annoyed me, but one of them was that she would put up fights sometimes for seemingly no reason besides being difficult. She accepts the fact that Claude often uses her as a means to get information, and sends her to other aristos as a “courtesan” even if that’s not her real purpose, yet she is super insulted when Thorne asks Claude to “lend her to him” for the duration of his stay, because he didn’t ask her directly, and she had no say in Claude’s answer... But how is that any different than all the times Claude sent her to glean information while pretending to be a courtesan?Lis also gives the impression that she is a fighter at first, but she ended up being quite helpless, and even though she complained a lot about it, in the end, she just did what everyone around her told her to do, which is even more frustrating considering that she is quite clever. Add to that the repetitive bland banter between Thorne and her, and her unending inner monologues, and it made for a character that could have been very interesting but ended up being just ordinary.Thorne is nothing special really. He reminded me of Casteel and Nyktos at times, but not nearly as interesting or fleshed out. Also, the whole Na’laa nickname was cute, but at the same time, I felt that it was just too similar to the Liessa title in ASITE. It’s as if the author took the same ideas and even very similar dialogues, but she switched Liessa for Na’laa and that was it.The dynamic between Thorne and Lis was not the best either. Sure, there is a lot of sexual tension between them, but I didn’t feel any real chemistry. We know that they are strangely attracted to each other, but we know it because they said it, not because we felt it. There is smut, of course, but to the point where it overshadowed the plot at times, and it also felt as if some situations happened just to create an opening for more smutty moments between Thorne and Lis. Overall, I was disappointed by that book. After reading the sneak peak available on Amazon I was super hyped, but it ended up being long and repetitive for most of the book, and the plot is secondary to the smut and relationship development between Lis and Thorne (if you can call the bland banter they share and need to get naked together a relationship). I might give the second book a try, because I do believe that there is potential in this series, and I am curious to see where this is going, but I am not sure yet. I guess I will see how I feel about it when the second book comes out.Follow me on Instagram  slightly_smiling_face \n",

      "This will probably be an unpopular review, but it is what it is. I like JLA books, I really do! I love Blood and Ash and Flesh and Fire, and I was actually convinced she was improving a lot as a writer.I did think an editor would improve her work, thus my excitement to see her new book being published by TOR. Such . . . a . . . disappointment!So . . . about . . . this . . . book:- You take Blood and Ash and mix it up with Flesh and Fire. - You search for synonyms of intriguing and opt for interesting and enthralling- Liessa is used already . . . You decide to change it for na’laa- you eliminate all traces of a plot- You remove gradual world building and add it all up as info dump at 70% (you all know what usually happens at this point of the story).- To increase the length of the book, you use ellipsis every chance you get! Don’t forget to add a space between every dot, this will ensure you barely need to write a story.- Procede to add bits of plot in the last 15% of the book, in between some intense action scenes, so you can prepare a cliffhanger to hook readers for a second book.- To make it TikTok worth it, you add smut every chance you get. If everything goes right, nobody will notice they are reading recycled material without any story behind.The characters:- Lis is special, obviously, but she is no maiden! She is some rich lord paramour, and sometimes even works as a courtesan. She is abused ALL THE TIME, but apparently, she only complains when is the MMC, and she actually wants it. As the story goes on, she slowly converts into Poppy, finds herself a dagger and stars throwing things to MMC. More powers appear and I expect she will be a Queen at the end of the series.- Cas and Niktos had a son, but he is horny and feeds on desire. Said horniness will avoid the necessity of creating a personality for Thorne, maybe on the second book. He senses (and sees) the FMC being abused, but he is very hungry, so he let's everything happen, and patiently waits for his turn. Unfortunately, I don’t believe I will continue with this series.\n",

      "in terms of LTs other series, im already enjoying this more than the four horsemen series, but not as much as the bargainer.i really liked the atmosphere/setting and the vast cast of different paranormal people/communities make for a diverse world. both main characters are interesting and easy to like. and the prose is the kind of writing that is so dang easy to binge read. one second youre on the first page and suddenly its two hours later and nearly 200 pages have flown by. but i will say this book does a really good job at giving the reader more questions than answers. it follows the trend of leaving little bread crumbs but never the actual piece of bread, so i did get frustrated with that at times. buuuuut its very effective at making me eagerly wait for the next book so i can satisfy my dying curiosity. so lets hope the next year goes by quickly!thank you for the ARC, sourcebooks / bloom books.↠ 4 stars\n",

      "if a spell was needed for making it through this book, one of the ingredients would be:\"tears from a broken heart (using mine-hope they work)\"I badly wanted to like this. I mean I adore this author so of course it's a no brainer. . . Needless to say, I am disappointed. I can't even begin to tell you the emotions I've had throughout this book and the ending cliffhanger brought on something completely indescribable. Some of which is frustration, that is for sure. I mean the blurb says it all. I don't have the capacity to summarize this book, so my recommendation is: just read the blurb. The main characters are entirely unlikeable. Selene is naive, easily coerced, has very little self-respect, and not the most memorable character. Memnon is probably one of the worst MMC ever written. You know how in an enemies to lovers romance, when one of them does something bad, its usually redeemable? THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE. I have read plenty enemies to lovers books and I feel like I've read it all. Different levels of groveling can usually do the trick in any one of them. Here? There is no going back from the things Memnon put Selene through. He is legitimately the definition of an asshole. Meanwhile Selene:\"What are you doing?\" I demand. I should rip his hand away. The ugly truth, however, is that I like his touch, even after all the shit he just pulled.Um excuse me. Have some backbone, Selene! I mean the girl legitimately suffers from Stockholm syndrome nearly within a few days. This book would've been better if it was slow burn because with the amount of repetitive spice and kissing it is entirely unreasonable for the timeline and relationship status. Also, Memnon is very - touch her you die. Which for anyone that loves a possessive MMC, that is entirely acceptable and wanted. But he nearly kills the most genuine character in the book, and I just wanted to scream. If the victim was unlikeable, okay, but he was probably the best character in the book other than Selene's best friend and familiar. A lot happens and very fast, your kind of just left hanging on throughout the ride wondering which direction its headed. There are a few scene jumps and the timeline feels rushed. The two MCs also spend 80% of the entire book in disagreement. Selene finally gains common sense around the 84% point, then immediately loses it after seeing Memnon in a tux. . . I'm once again speechless. The switch flip between Memnon's moods. Holy gods, I could not grasp it. Talk about whiplash. Selene will no doubt have to see a therapist by the end of this series. I would've liked to see a tougher FMC. Also, most of the spice and kissing is non-consensual but still somehow consensual that I couldn't wrap my mind around it. The number of times I asked myself, how are we supposed to even like him at this point? And if you're looking for a love confession that sets your soul on fire. You're not getting that either. The best parts of this book are: 1. Selene's familiar.2. Selene's best friend because she is genuinely funny and a great friend.3. Kane. The love interest that we all would've actually liked. The cliffhanger was shocking only because I was so wrapped up in the events of the last chapter that I was sitting there in silent shock. All I could think was, why? This book gets two stars because I am just barely hooked enough to skim read the next one to see how any of this is resolved.\n",

      "4.25 star There‘s hardly anything that I find more stressful than when there‘s a big fat lie between the MCs and one of them knows about it and the other is completely oblivious. That‘s also the case with this book. It‘s giving me Bridge Kingdom level kind of stress. I just kept hoping and hoping for a quick reveal, but nope. Of course not.I loved this book, don‘t get me wrong, but that lie just makes everything so uncomfortable. The smut? Hot! But here‘s me thinking „oh that sounds like a fantastic way to lose your V card BUT HE‘S STILL OBLIVIOUS, SHE WAS SENT TO KILL YOU and ooooooh I love it when things get feral BUT BEWARE, SHE‘S GOING TO BREAK YOUR HEART“ (and nope, that‘s really not a spoiler.. look at the title and surprise surprise there‘s smut in a fantasy romance book). I mean, of course the FMC falls for the MMC and abandons her task, but damn.I‘m just a stupid soft-hearted baby.Thay being said, Sylina was such a good FMC (and of course her lying was understandable). Atrius was also great - we love a broody king who‘s a softie at heart.And a special shout out for Erekkus  face_holding_back_tears  heart_hands_medium-light_skin_tone  Love him so much.I can‘t wait to see more of those two in future books. I now also really want for the House of Blood to have a good revenge arc. On that note I would like for Carissa Broadbent to cast Septimus as a MMC. His hotness would be completely wasted otherwise.\n",

      "i’m disappointed. this book was definitely better than the first one. the chemistry between mmc and fmc was there and it was good until it wasn’t but about that later. i won’t continue the series bc my eyes are hurting from all eyerolling.  face_with_rolling_eyes  face_with_rolling_eyes  face_with_rolling_eyes wanted to cry when there was a new pov.  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face  it ruined TOG and CC for me. also the time jump was in the new pov… i didn’t care what this new old character did 286 years ago, why couldn’t it be some story in a book? or someone’s memory of them?fine, i appreciated serce just bc she wasn’t cowering before atlas.  “If he proved worthy, she might even allow him to join her from time to time.” bad points for serce.  “she’d never looked closely enough to understand the differences between the low fae’s various species.” the only thing i liked about serce at the end was her love for wolf. they were wonderful together. i wished the fmc lor was like serce in this department. at the beginning nadir was acting like an immature child. no wonder he was only a prince. at least atlas was already a king. every male in this series had some pathetic excuse for his behavior. in the last book it was like “because atlas is just a male and can’t control his urges”. face_with_rolling_eyes  face_with_rolling_eyes  face_with_rolling_eyes  “I know Nadir can come off as…abrasive,” Amya says. “But it’s just because he feels so much. It’s hard for him to be casual about anything.” i thought they were too careless coming to aurora under king’s nose. it was going to backfire eventually. and it did. i liked the tension and chemistry, it was definitely better than the first book. but midway the book i wished they fucked already. enough was enough. they didn’t fuck. what the fuck was that at a party with vale? all the progress between nadir and lor gone. so disappointing. i decided i hate when main characters decide to “break up”. couldn’t they see they were stronger together? fmc flipped out about nadir’s possessiveness and his careless comment about her being whore which he apologized for later..? that’s all or did i miss something? bc in my opinion fmc made a bigger deal about it than it really was. at one point i wanted to smack fmc. she ruined the romantic plot for me. she was a crybaby about everything else. the plot was okay but the heroine annoyed me. i thought they picked terrible time and place to have sex they didn’t have sex for the first time. they found the crown so there obviously appeared some shift in magic and everyone felt it. didn’t they understand the danger or that they should get out of the location quickly?? i wasn’t surprised when the aurora king showed up. so what happened in this book? fmc reunited with her siblings and they found the crown. that’s all.  clown_face  clown_face  clown_face  nothing happened in romantic arc bc fmc ruined everything just bc some ancient artifact told her “that it will ruin her”. what was the point of this book? there was no climax. no returning of her power or glorious smut scenes. at one point i began to pity mmc bc he deserved better.\n",

      "3.75 StarsFae, romance, and magic?! Sign me up! Prisca, a young and ambitious woman, embarks on a perilous mission to rescue her close friend who has been captured and taken to the heavily guarded city. As she makes her way towards the city, she runs into a group of tough-looking mercenaries. Despite her initial fear, she engages them in conversation and they soon strike a deal. The mercenaries offer to teach Prisca how to harness her magical abilities, a skill that will undoubtedly come in handy during her rescue mission. In exchange, they ask for her help in gaining entry into the city. Will Prisca be able to use her powers to save her friend? I really enjoyed the beginning and ending of the novel. However, I felt that the middle section could have benefitted from a faster pace and more engaging plot points. Additionally, while the characters were interesting, I would have appreciated more depth to their development. Nonetheless, I found the novel to be enjoyable overall and I am excited to see how the series progresses.*** Thank you to NetGalley, Stacia Stark, and Dreamscape Media for graciously sending me the audiobook to review.

      "So I saw this on TikTok, which should have been my first red flag I know, but then I saw all these 5 star reviews and I got excited. That excitement quickly died. This started off decently, I enjoyed Arwens character (at first), I liked where the story was going- exchanging herself for her brothers debt, her healing abilities, her exchanges with the ‘strange prisoner’, even the small plot twist with said prisoner, which was predictable, but I moved on. Then I got about 200 pages in and all of sudden our main character becomes this juvenile, whiny child who is asking for relationship advice on the evil king who is holding her captive and has threatened her family’s lives. Huh?? The king, kinda cringey if I’m honest, was trying to hard to be morally grey/sweet. It was just giving me the ick. Also there was zero chemistry, it just felt so forced and flat.

      "4.5 StarsThis was a fantastic beginning to what looks to be a very engaging and well written fantasy romance. The world building with this one was beyond excellent and was very well done add in the fact that this is a debut author well I’m excited now to see how this author evolves further.This story is the first book in a series it’s set in a fantasy realm that’s currently locked in a devastating war and it has an enemies to lovers theme at its centre. Be aware the romance side of this is very slow burn so don’t go into this expecting high-steam as this one is really all about building the tension and setting the scene. This did work and despite this not having much of that particular element included Arwen and Kane still had lots of delicious chemistry and banter together and they felt authentic and when it eventually then progressed it’s obvious that its definitely to come in the future.This is sole POV Arwen’s and when we initially join her she’s still in her small town in the kingdom of Amber residing there with her younger sister and mother whilst her brother is currently away having been drafted into the Amber kings army.After no word for a year the family obviously think the worst so when Ryder suddenly appears injured and running from the Onyx kings men in his possession stolen enemy gold the family's only real option really is to run using the pilfered gold to try and buy safe passage somewhere far away from this awful war. But when a chain of events then places Arwen in a position where she is now the prisoner of the notorious Onyx king Kane her life changes beyond all recognition.Arwen has the gift of healing and it's this talent she ends up bartering with to save her life. Her handsome arrogant jailor Kane is determined she pays her brother's debt in his stead but he is also surprisingly kind to her and though Arwen tries so hard to hate him she also can’t help reluctantly falling for his many charms.I liked Kane as a character he was surprisingly level-headed and protective when it came to Arwen. I initially thought this was going to have a much darker vibe mostly because of the beginning scenes but the building bond between these two was actually very sweet and Kane was patience personified when it came to Arwen's many mistakes.Arwen was such a contradiction on the one hand I loved how loyal she was to those she considered her own but I also thought she then made rash thoughtless decisions in the moment without much thought to the consequences and when it came to Kane she could also be quite prejudiced and very blinkered. She definitely seemed to hold him to a different standard than everyone else and she wasn’t willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.Kane by contrast was always willing to overlook Arwens many missteps even when they had a negative impact. The secrets he was keeping close that were eventually revealed I also think were justified and his reasonings behind them sound. Arwen played true to form though and once again was not willing to look beyond her own hurt and pain. I’m hoping going forward she grows some as a character and abandons this particular character trait, maybe she should take a leaf out of Kane's book.This had really good world immersion without it feeling like an info-dump. This managed to gradually draw you in and it was such an engaging well written read. My only negatives here were Arwen sometimes irritated me with her judgements of Kane and that this could still have been slow-burn but with maybe a few more romantic interactions added between Kane and Arwen. Other than that this was a great read and extremely impressive for a debut. I will definitely be continuing on with this series now it’s managed to easily capture my imagination and I can’t wait to see how this all evolves going forward though this one is to be continued it didn’t feel like it ended things on a major cliffhanger, so I’m happy to anticipate the second book without wanting to throw my kindle vibes. If you like fantasy slow-burn romance that focuses on the world building this is the series for you.

      "At the risk of sounding mean, a thought which frequently occurred to me while reading this was “ah, Leigh Bardugo is just making shit up”. While this might seem obvious given that this is a fantasy novel, what I mean is that I was constantly pulled out of the flow of reading a book by the weird ways in which the way it’s written inadvertently draws attention to itself as a text composed of sentences written to meet a word count for publishers.For the sake of organizing my Many Thoughts I shall chunk this review into sections.1. Demington (nick name is a work in progress) This issue is a light one to start off with but I have to say Darlington in demon form radiates total YA energy. It feels like an image of a character designed with the express purpose of appealing to the tiktok girlies. He is totally naked and more muscular in demon form than in human form and his hair has grown to a sexy shoulder length and he has golden horns and golden eyes and golden tattoos and his “cock [is] very erect and shining like a supercharged, oversized glowstick” (65) (the fact that his erect penis is emitting a heavenly light is mentioned no less than three times in case you thought you misread this). 2. People Don’t Act Like PeopleIn a scene that seemingly comes out of nowhere, Alex decides on a whim to explain not only that magic is real to her normie roommate Mercy Zhao but also to summarize the entire plot of Ninth House including Darlington getting sent to hell and coming back half in and half out of reality as a literal demon who Alex needs to either save or kill before the hellbeast overtakes him and destroys the world or some shit. Mercy’s reaction leaves much to be desired in terms of being a reaction that a normal human being would have to anything at all. She immediately believes everything, says that it all makes sense given Alex’s behaviour the past year of sneaking out of the dorms sometimes and having the occasional depressive episode, and tells Alex not to lie to her again. She also mentions that she’s been using a therapy app because reviewers of Ninth House complained about Mercy’s seeming lack of doing anything post being a vehicle for a rape revenge plot and the author wants us to know she read those complaints and mercy is indeed in therapy. At the end of the conversation, most of which happens off page and is summarized in a sentence or two, when Alex is walking away, Mercy ends this already unnatural conversation with the most YA novel response one could have to learning that demons are real by asking Alex if Darlington is the reason she hasn’t dated anyone in the 12 months she has known her. Alex waffles about how he’s “too expensive” and also has horns and Mercy jokes about how well she has a birthmark shaped like wisconsin. Very bizarre to end this scene with playful teasing about the potential darlington/alex ship when one of the parties is currently trapped in a demonic circle half in half out of hell and might have to be put down if they can’t separate him from his demon in time.2. 1. People Don’t Act Like People → Mercy is Not a PersonMercy Zhao’s entire character is predicated on being a non character. She is the ultimate NPC. Any reaction she has no matter how inhuman in its sheer lack of reaction can’t be called “out of character” because very little characterization was ever established to begin with. She is Nice, she is booksmart, and she wears quirky clothes. I hesitate to call this meagre collection of traits even two dimensional.In Ninth House, Mercy exists because Leigh Bardugo wanted an excuse to have a scene where a rapist eats shit, so the rapist must first have a victim to rape, and Mercy just happens to be the vehicle through which this revenge plot travels. Someone needs to notify Alex’s mom of her temporary funk so she can be drawn out of said funk and progress the rest of the plot, and Mercy, who has not been in the narrative since the rape plot and will continue to not be in the narrative for the rest of the book, luckily just happens to be there. I suspect Leigh Bardugo heard the negative response some critics had to Mercy’s lack of involvement in the first book, so in Hell Bent when Alex and the gang need a fifth person to complete their HellQuest, Mercy is just slotted in there to give her something to do. She doesn’t even join in on HellQuest proper, she just stands guard out of frame while everyone else goes to hell.This Mercy effect, (being absent from the until Leigh Bardugo needs a side character to progress the plot and inexplicably materializing), is at its most literal and by extension most absurd in Chapter 9. Alex meets with Dawes to discuss plot shit which eventually leads to them debating how they are going to find a fifth person for HellQuest, when Mercy interrupts them stating that she will be their fifth person. Apparently she has just been sitting on the couch in the same room as them this entire time. She followed Alex in, and neither Alex or Dawes notice this whole ass human being entering and just sitting down within earshot for this entire conversation until they express their need for a side character and Mercy asserts herself as the one for the job. Alex and Dawes warn her of the danger of doing the hell portal opening ritual, but Mercy calmly tosses aside their concerns as if it is inconceivable that anyone but her could be doing the ritual. And Alex and Dawes also quickly just accept it. It’s like they’re all aware they are characters in a novel and it is unfathomable that anyone else would do this task, even someone more qualified (i.e. has known magic even existed for more than like a day) because Mercy is a named character and Leigh Bardugo has to make her a player in the plot because reviewers complained in the last book about Mercy disappearing from the book after her utility as a rape victim was finished.2. 2. People Don’t Act Like People → People Don’t Care About What the Reader Already Knows Not To Care AboutAlso in the vein of people not asking questions normal human beings would, a pivotal part of HellQuest is finding four murderers to walk the gauntlet. Alex, Dawes, and Turner have all already killed someone, so they use a magical slave catching device to locate their fourth murderer, who ends up being side character Tripp Helmuth. (As an aside, Turner is outraged at the repurposed slave catching magical gizmo, but aside from a line in the acknowledgements where Leigh Bardugo links a website about the history of slavery at Yale this never becomes relevant to the book in terms of plot or theme. To me it read as a shoehorned aside for Bardugo to let us know that she is in fact Aware of Slavery and its badness, but the legacy of slavery will never be interrogated by the book because it’s not relevant to Alex’s personal journey). Anyway, Tripp is presented as a bumbling idiot who the gang is just relieved to have as a fourth member. Not a single person stops to ask him “by the way Tripp, who did you murder?”. In fact nobody asks each other who they killed upon revelation that they did indeed kill someone, even though I feel like it would be something most people would at least be curious about, even a little. After they’ve already gone to hell once, Mercy asks Alex who she killed, and Alex says some vague lines about it being “too many people” and how she doesn’t feel bad about any of it. Mercy responds to the revelation that Alex is a serial killer the same way she reacts to the revelation that magic is real, which is to say not at all. We as the audience know that the killings were all either in self defence or under the influence of ghost possession, and I guess Mercy is just in tune with the vibes of everything being chill. In a paragraph elaborating Alex’s angst she refers to herself as “the only real sinner in the bunch [the bunch in question being the murderers]”, because Dawes killed defending Alex from a violent attacker, Turner is a cop so presumably he just killed some guy on duty who had it coming (kind of a fucked up assumption imo but this review is long enough), and also absolves Tripp of any sin because “muddleheaded Tripp had no doubt bumbled into something he couldn’t handle” (242). This strikes me as kind of an insane claim to make when not only does Alex not know anything about who Tripp killed because nobody asked, but also because it was kind of a major theme of the first book about how rich white boys can use their wealth and status to absolve themselves of any responsibility in harming people less privileged. We soon learn through hell induced memory sharing shenanigans that Tripp is indeed Not a Bad Dude, he just chose not to act when his abuser died as a result of his own actions, but I don’t like how up until the reveal the novel frames the question of “wait, who did this guy murder?” as something we don’t even need to think about, let alone worry about. 3. Gritty Tone??? Near the very end Hell Bent contains a graphic flashback of animal death and it's one of the most gruesome parts of the whole book. It took me a while to work out why I was so upset by this one scene of animal gore when there are so many human on human violence scenes in Ninth House which I didn't take offense to but other people did. I am not usually one to gate keep who can and cannot include certain material in their books, but I think the issue here for me stems from whether or not shocking content is appropriate to the rest of the text surrounding it. I didn't find the sexual assault scenes in Ninth House beyond the pale because one of the major themes of Ninth House is sexual assault and how people in power cover it up. The whole book in terms of theme and tone was building up to those sexual assault scenes. I didn't consider them shock value because they weren't shocking based on the way the book builds up to them in terms of plot and tone. Hell Bent, however, lacks any thematic clarity that would make this scene necessary or even make sense thematically (I've already mentioned how Bardugo is willing to name drop acts of historical cruelty but doesn't actually follow up on them with the repurposed slave catching device). There seems to be very little thematic coherency here at all. It also isn't justified by the tone, because as mentioned, this book feels incredibly YA most of the time. Just recall my first point, Demington. It's very telling to me that Leigh Bardugo is willing to go into graphic detail of the murder of a beloved pet rabbit for shock value but refuses to let literally being physically trapped in hell affect Darlington in any way that would make him even marginally less sexy. It frankly seems kind of cowardly to me that she didn't even let Darlington look even a little fucked up! Gritty realism comes second in these books, Feeding Thirst is the top priority, at the expense of everything else.4. HellquestI hate HellQuest so much it’s unreal. I was a defender of the first book from people who called it “boring” but even I have to admit this shit drags. The whole novel is just a series of failed rituals we have to hear about in excruciating detail to get free Darlington from hell and you can really feel the book treading water for the majority of the page length. After failed rituals a big fuss is made about finding murderers to walk the gauntlet to enter hell and it’s a whole big thing with so much page space dedicated to it, and it fails like all the rituals before it. Darlington’s soul isn’t freed until 400 pages in, when he tells Alex that because of her special abilities she can literally just choose to enter hell herself without any rituals, and she does. It feels kind of audacious for Leigh Bardugo to waffle on for 400 pages about every step of this complicated ritual to get into hell and have the characters go through with the ritual and suffer and fail, only for that to be followed up “oh btw you could just step through this portal to hell any time you want because of your specialness” and having the protagonist just skip the several hundred page process by walking through a portal to solve the problem. Anyway after Darlington is freed HellQuest isn’t over because they have to go back AGAIN for plot reasons, but they need all four to go and only Alex can fast travel so we have to watch them walk the gauntlet AGAIN. And then! And then! The cliffhanger at the end! Is that hell is still open! And they have to do HellQuest AGAIN in the third book!!!!!!!!!!! What The Fuck! What The Fuck! I HATE HellQuest! It’s So BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway I didn’t think Hell Bent was very good lol\n",

      "Another epic, sweeping fantasy from the mastermind behind  The Priory of the Orange Tree and  The Bone Season series.Tunuva Melim is a sister of the Priory. Her calling is to protect the world from the inevitable rise of the Nameless One, a monster who sleeps in the fires of the Dreadmount.Glorian Berethnet is the princess of Inys and heir to her mother's throne, in a long line of female monarchs whose bloodline keeps the Nameless One at bay.Across the sea in Seiiki, Dumai has spent her life as a godsinger on Mount Ipyeda, a frigid and isolated world away from the politics of the throne room she may be destined for.Samantha Shannon weaves the three stories together, along with a few additional characters in each perspective, beautifully. She thrives in giving us rich and interesting people to follow who aren't without their flaws. When read as a character-driven story, this book excels. I think the plot, especially for a nearly 900 page book, does drag at times, despite each chapter giving us some additional piece of the overall puzzle.I enjoyed this book a lot, especially that it's a standalone prequel to Priory. Though I don't know if I *loved* it as much as I remember loving that one. I think there were certain perspectives in this story at times that got too much attention, while I would have preferred sticking to other storylines longer. I also found many of the plotpoints in this predictable and saw the 'twists' coming from a mile away. In fact, the plot to me is probably the weakest part of the story. Knowing it's a standalone, I assumed exactly how it would end from the start and it does just about that. Of course there are little moments here and there you don't necessarily know will happen until they do, but the overall arc of the story is pretty classic for fantasy.Definitely worth the read, but not one I think I would revisit any time soon, if ever again. However, I love her world-building and it does make me want to revisit Priory to see how I feel about it now and to make the connections with the information we receive in this prequel.\n",

      "“Perhaps it is always restful to be around someone who does not expect anything from you beyond what is in your nature.”\n",
      "This is as wholesome as you guys made it out to be. Such a cure for the soul. Not only that, but it is also clever, absolutely hilarious, and adorable. It even has its fair share of action. It's also narrated as a diary, which I like, but it always makes me wonder how a person could possibly remember their day-to-day in such detail. Although, Emily Wilde seems more than capable of that. Besides, what I particularly liked in this book are the folktales. I have no idea if they are real stories or not but they are amazing, though they would be even more impressive if the author had come up with them. They are rarely added in books which makes me love them even more whenever I find them.Moreover, Emily is one of the most badass nerds I've ever read. She reminds me a lot of Evelyn from The Mummy. She likes books, research, and all that, but she is also a dedicated explorer. She likes adventure, discovering anything she can about the faeries, and tends to put herself in dangerous situations. She is also socially awkward, uptight, and prefers books to people. She's basically my spirit animal...except I'm not that smart. What I love most about her is how apathetic and absorbed in her work she can be, although this does not mean she lacks any emotions, only a few morals. It was really funny how she would only help people if it was beneficial to her research.Furthermore, Wendell Bambleby is such a wonderfully hot mess of a person. He is such a spoiled brat, even though he is probably in his thirties. He is pretty terrible at his job too. He apparently fabricates a lot of his work and prefers to lounge around than do actual field work, but he makes up for it by being charming and unreasonably beautiful. Oh, and making clothes and shoes for Emily! Yeah, he literally makes clothes for her. I'd say that's a fair balance. He is also not the kind of person who would break a sweat for anyone, even if they are in danger unless, of course, that person is Emily. There's a whole lot he would do for her, which is why I love him so much. Also, because he is so unbelievably hilarious and he doesn't even have to try. Every scene with him had me in stitches, especially his contribution to Emily's journaling. That man is a keeper.Lastly, I love the chemistry between Emily and Wendell. They are the epitome of 'opposites attract' and it fills my heart with joy every time they banter and argue with each other. They also have this rivals-to-lovers/frienemies dynamic that makes their interactions even more delightful. For all his faults, he is a total simp for Emily, who is not as oblivious to his emotions as one would've thought, and the way he goes from lazy kissass to a feral monster/storybook hero whenever she's in danger makes life worth living. I also love the terms of endearment he uses for her which are basically a variation of the word 'crazy'. How adorable is that? As for Emily, while she is apathetic and uninterested in helping others, she becomes a heaping mess if something happens to Wendell. There's still a long way to go when it comes to their relationship and the romance isn't exactly the main focus of the story, but I hope there's a lot more in the second book.\n",

      "4.5 stars. I loved this so much and now I'm mad that I can't find another academia-centric faerie fantasy set in early 1900s Scandinavia. The diary format works so well, especially in tempering my anxiety since Emily had to be alive/relatively healthy to write the diary entry in the first place.  grinning_face_with_sweat  The first 20% is decent as a standoffish Emily settles into a remote village with prickly locals, but then the book gets AMAZING when Wendell shows up. I know the blurb calls him an academic rival, but that's not really accurate. They're friends (while Emily is frequently irked by his presence, she still considers Wendell to be her only friend). I don't want to spoil anything more, but I highly recommend this novel (might bump it up to a 5 stars when I reread the audiobook). These are not the best comps (struggling to come up with anything, tbh), but this book might appeal to fans of Naomi Novik and Olivia Atwater? I think??? Don't hate me if I'm completely off the mark.  grinning_face_with_sweat  This book is very weird to review because the humor is sly and biting (even when Emily is anti-social and oblivious), but it's definitely not a fantasy rom-com. I don't think it's lighthearted or cozy like Howl's Moving Castle, even if some aspects gave me those vibes (Wendell, in particular, has Intense Howl Energy). The faerie kidnapping elements are terrifying and I shivered constantly during the latter half (admittedly I am easy to scare, especially when I'm reading at night). So... it's just a mix of all emotions. I'm sorry, I'm doing a terrible job describing the tone, but definitely check it out if the blurb intrigues you. FYI for romance readers: this is a historical fantasy with (very enjoyable) romantic elements, not a romance. The ending feels like a plausible HFN (can't really go into detail without spoilers but you won't be unhappy).

I finally read Chakraborty’s book for the first time, and it certainly will not be the last.\n",
      "“Exaggerations, but the truth scarcely matters when it comes to a good tale.”\n",
      "Since her debut novel, The City of Brass, was published in 2017, Chakraborty is a name that keeps getting more popularity and recognition with each new book. That debut was six years ago. It is unbelievable that it took me this long to finally read a book written by Shannon Chakraborty for the first time. The first trilogy by her, The Daevabad Trilogy, was completed in the year 2020, and it is a historical fantasy series with a lot of diehard fans. A LOT. And yes, I am ashamed to admit I haven't read that trilogy yet. That said, The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is a new book in a new series by her taking place in the same world as The Daevabad Trilogy, but before the events of The City of Brass. And it is very much possible to read this without reading The Daevabad Trilogy first. Because of that, and also the stunning cover art by Ivan Belikov (US edition) that got my attention, I decided to read The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi first instead before reading The Daevabad Trilogy. I am happy to say I had a fun time reading it, and if possible, I would love to read The Daevabad Trilogy before the release of the second book in the Amina al-Sirafi trilogy.Picture: The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Ivan BelikovThe Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is the first book in the Amina al-Sirafi trilogy by Shannon Chakraborty. Amina al-Sirafi was once one of the most notorious pirates in the Indian Ocean. She has survived backstabbing rogues, vengeful merchant princes, several husbands, and one actual demon. But now, she has retired peacefully to a life of piety and motherhood with her daughter, Marjana. But then, an extremely wealthy mother of a former crewman finds out about Amina’s location, and she decides to visit her and offers her a job she cannot refuse. The job is to retrieve her granddaughter in exchange for one million dinars upon completion. Amina has the chance to have one last adventure with her crew, do right by an old friend, and win a fortune that will secure her family’s future forever. But of course, it becomes alarmingly clear there’s more to this job and the girl’s disappearance. There is always risk in wanting to become a legend, to seize one last chance at glory, and Amina and her shipmates will face a new kind of danger in their mission. This is the general premise of The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi, and the story is told almost entirely through her perspective that she is telling to a scribe named Jamal.\n",
      "“For this scribe has read a great many of these accounts and taken away another lesson: that to be a woman is to have your story misremembered. Discarded. Twisted.”\n",
      "As I said earlier, I haven’t read The Daevabad Trilogy yet, so I can’t make an accurate comparison on which one is better between The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi and The Daevabad Trilogy. Or how similar they are to one another. But as far as I know, The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is a different kind of book and series that takes place in the same world, but again, before the beginning of The Daevabad Trilogy. It is a swashbuckling adventure with themes of motherhood, wealth, freedom, and found family. I will say, though, I am not sure whether I heard this wrong or not, but I thought this book would have a heist-centered narrative. And due to the main character being a pirate, I expected this book would be full of sea adventure portions like The Tide Child trilogy by R.J. Barker, for example. These, for better or worse, were not the case. There was indeed a mission, and obviously, there were seafaring sections, but almost the entire story in the book takes place on the land. This is not a complaint. Generally speaking, seafaring portions in fantasy novels tend to bore me. So I am pleased most of the story takes place on land instead of the sea. But I AM a fan of heist stories. Unfortunately, the supposed heist was the standard main quest to retrieve the granddaughter instead of a heist comprised of intricate planning. And, well, stealing something.Picture: The Crew of Marawati by April Damon\n",
      "“I have traveled widely enough that I take everything written about “foreigners” with doubt and know better than to judge a community by their worst individuals.”\n",
      "Although I enjoyed reading this book, that and one other issue are why I cannot give this book a higher rating than 3.5 stars. I mentioned that found family is one of the tropes implemented into The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi. The first half of the novel is about getting the band back together. But the characters felt likable only on the surface level. They were there simply to help drive the story forward. But that was it. The found family trope was evident in the narrative, but other than Amina herself, the other supporting characters did not feel developed enough for me to remember them distinctly. Tinbu, in particular, was incredibly forgettable. I had to research his name again because I already forgot his name at the time of writing this review. Dalila and Majed’s roles in the story, and also their characterizations, were more prominent, and I liked them. But still, they were not focused and developed enough. A few days or a week from now, there is a good chance I will not remember them anymore. This could totally be fixed in the upcoming books, and it might just be the plan to do that, but for now, it feels like a missed opportunity from my perspective because I do like Amina as a character, and I liked seeing Amina’s affection for her shipmates.\n",
      "“How much easier her life would be if she were rich. For while the pious claim money doesn’t buy happiness, I can attest from personal experience that poverty buys nothing. It is a monster whose claws grow deeper and more difficult to escape with each passing season, with even the slightest misstep setting you back years, if not forever.”\n",
      "It can be argued that Amina's first-person POV narration is why the characterizations and focus on Amina were so much more dominant. However, some of my favorite fantasy series and books with first-person narration, like the recently released The Will of the Many by James Islington or Red Rising Saga by Pierce Brown, to mention a few, managed to make me care deeply about the supporting characters almost as much as I care about the main character. Sometimes even more, in the case of Sevro to Darrow! At the very least, I can remember them distinctly, and I truly hope I will grow to like Amina's shipmates more in the sequel. Because I do think Chakraborty's prose was captivating enough, and she is a great storyteller. If the first half was about gathering the band back together, the second half was about executing the mission and navigating all the chaos that came from it. I found the second half of The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi more engaging than the first half, even when the villains and the truth behind the Moon of Saba felt comical. But the adventure along with the themes of social injustice and faiths implemented, plus Amina's struggle in juggling her responsibility as a mother and doing what she would love to do, has made the narrative intriguing for me.\n",
      "“For the greatest crime of the poor in the eyes of the wealthy has always been to strike back. To fail to suffer in silence and instead disrupt their lives and their fantasies of a compassionate society that coincidentally set them on top. To say no.”\n",
      "Do note that this is a historical fantasy novel. The story takes place in our world in the past, but despite that, there were plenty of fantastical elements to keep the readers engaged if you’re in it for the fantasy aspects, such as sea monsters, demons, forbidden artifacts, djinns, and more. Also, I should mention that historical fantasy isn’t usually my preference for reading. I love historical fiction, but I rarely click with historical fantasy novels. But because of where I live, some of the terminologies used in this book were fascinating. I am a Chinese born and raised in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. But I did not realize how similar some Indonesian words are to Arabic until I read this book. Even though I probably should’ve guessed that. Muslim is a religion that is portrayed heavily in The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi. And well, here’s a fun fact. Indonesia is the country with the largest population of Muslims in the entire world. More or less 13% of the world’s Muslims. And Jakarta, the capital city, is the largest city in Southeast Asia. Although I am not Muslim, as a citizen here, seeing daily words here like fajr (fajar in Indonesian means dawn), raja (king in Indonesian), nikah (marriage in Indonesian), Iblis (devil in Indonesian), peri (fairy in Indonesian), and Quran, Inshallah, Masjid, was a refreshing reading experience. I rarely see these in Western-published fantasy novels.\n",

      "Picture: Map of the Great Indian Ocean by Virginia AllynSpeaking of djinns and peri, I believe there were cameo appearances from the characters in The Daevabad Trilogy here. But again, I do not think it is a MUST to read The Daevabad Trilogy first before reading this book. The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi works really well as your first time reading Chakraborty's book, and more importantly, it is a great and fun start to a new trilogy. It is easily one of the most hyped new fantasy releases of 2023, with plenty of special editions published already. Although I had a few issues with this book, I am assured this won't be the last time I read a book by Chakraborty. On top of looking forward to reading the continuation of Amina al-Sirafi's infamous and scandalous tale, I feel more energized to read The Daevabad Trilogy now.\n",

A perfect October read!If you've read my review of The Ten Thousand Doors of January, you already know that Harrow and I didn't get off to the best of starts.I could see glimmers of greatest, but that story just wasn't for me in anyway. In spite of that, I never write an author off after just one try, so have picked up other works from Harrow since then.I had a ton of fun with her Fractured Fables novellas and was ready to try this one out upon its release.This story is set in the small town of Eden, Kentucky, known for being the home to a reclusive 19th-Century author and illustrator, who mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind her gorgeous gothic estate, Starling House.We follow a young woman named, Opal, who hasn't had it easy. She cares for her younger brother and works hard every day to try to make ends meet. She wants a better life for him and sacrifices a lot.Through a series of interesting events, Opal ends up with a job offer to work at Starling House. She's to become the regular housekeeper for the estate; trust, a full-time job.Opal knows better than to mess with supposedly haunted houses, but regardless of her trepidation, she sort of needs this. Bonus, the house-cleaning position offers her the chance to get to know the last heir to the estate, the handsome, yet prickly, Arthur Starling.The story involves a lot of history of the house, the property, the Starling family, as well as the growing relationship between Opal and Arthur.I enjoyed learning about all that. Harrow made it so interesting. I just wanted to know more. I will note, there are footnotes utilized in telling this story, and although generally I am fairly ambivalent about their use, I felt here they worked quite well for providing the Reader with extra information needed to truly connect with this story.Starling House includes a trope, or maybe it's more accurate to call it a theme, that I have seen pop up recently in quite a few other novels. Most memorably, Hide, These Fleeting Shadows and Episode Thirteen.If you have read any of these, you may know the concept I'm referring. For me, this is BY FAR, the best that idea, or concept, has been brought to the page recently. I haven't enjoyed it in any other case, but there was something about the way Harrow told this story that just worked for me.I loved how dark and whimsical this felt, almost like a Dark Fairy Tale, but while also containing an 'our world' modern feel. It was almost a story out of time. It made me think about that television show, Once Upon a Time. Not because of the content, but just the overall vibe.I became quickly invested in this. Early on I was hooked. I loved how Harrow chose to tell and build out this story. It was easy to get invested in the characters and while I wasn't at the edge of my seat, I still didn't want it to end.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Adult Fiction with dark undertones. If unsettling atmosphere, potential whimsical monsters and dark fairy tales are your jam, you have to check this one out.I'm so glad that I continued to pick up Harrow's work and encourage every Reader to give authors a second chance. Delightful reads like this could be just around the corner.\n",

      "EXCERPT: I fished the stack of photographs from one of the sections and clumsily spread them out on the floor beside me, my eyes searching the many faces of Susanna Farrow. A baby in Gran's arms. A toddler in a pair of overalls, chest bare beneath the sagging straps. A young girl blowing out birthday candles. A teenage with wide, wire-rimmed glasses in the fields at the farm. My frantic hands finally stilled when I found the one I was looking for - a Susanna who was in her twenties, I guessed.She stood beneath the dogwood tree in the front yard, one hand absently reaching for the low-hanging branch beside her. Her hair was long and down, face turned to the street as if the picture was snapped the moment she saw someone coming down the sidewalk. So ordinary in the kind of way I'd always longed for. No hint or shadow in her eyes of what was to come.ABOUT 'THE UNMAKING OF JUNE FARROW': In the small mountain town of Jasper, North Carolina, June Farrow is waiting for fate to find her. The Farrow women are known for their thriving flower farm - and the mysterious curse that has haunted them for generations.The madness that led to Susanna Farrow's disappearance left her daughter, June, to be raised by her grandmother. Everyone in Jasper is certain it's only a matter of time before she finds the same end, but June has kept secret that her unravelling has already begun.After her grandmother's death, June follows a series of clues that link her mother's disappearance to the town's dark history, leading finally to a mysterious door.Behind it may lay the answer to the mysteries that have always lingered like a dark shadow. Upon crossing the threshold, June embarks on a journey that will not only change both the past and the future, but entangle her fate and her heart in a star-crossed love.MY THOUGHTS: I really loved the premise outlined in the synopsis of The Unmaking of June Farrow; however, I wasn't at all prepared for the time travel/slip trope that is the basis of this story. What I was expecting was a story of generational mental ill-health, but what I got was something very different. I doubt that I am the target audience for this book, but blame that on the synopsis.However, it's not all bad. Adrienne Young writes beautifully. Her prose is atmospheric and I felt compelled to continue reading, even when I had no idea what was going on. I was totally confounded by the strange rules surrounding where June could travel and how many times, and how the same characters were in different time periods at different ages than they should have been. It made absolutely no sense to me, and I am still confounded even after finishing. I adore the cover, and I'm quite sure that this is a wonderful book for those who like a whole lot more depth to their fantasy novels than I do.  star  star  star #TheUnmakingofJuneFarrow #NetGalleyTHE AUTHOR: When she’s not writing, you can find Adrienne on her yoga mat, on a walk in the woods, or planning her next travel adventure.

      "Ok, let me tell ya 'bout \"The Unmaking of June Farrow\" by Adrienne Young. This book? Pure gems, which have been thoroughly polished before being released to the world. It definitely had uniqueness that got me hooked, reeling' in emotions, mysteries, and some serious soul-searching. The narrative follows June Farrow on a journey that transcends the boundaries of the ordinary. Through all the ups and downs, June is a character that i was rooting for, empathizing with, and ultimately falling in love with. Her struggles, triumphs, and growth throughout the story are portrayed with such authenticity that it's impossible not to become emotionally invested in her fate.AUTHOR's world-building skills are on point.. The scenes are so vividly described that I felt like I was right there with the characters, exploring bustling streets and serene landscapes. The plot? Wild! Mixes up time-travel theme, mystery, and self-discovery like a boss. The pacing is just right, keeping me on my toes with deep thoughts, and twists I never see coming.The supporting cast of characters? They did wonderful job to make the story more strong. Each character contributes to the richness of the narrative, and I felt a genuine connection to their relationships with June.To be honest, I haven't read any of the author's other books, so I had no idea what the experience would be like with this one. I am glad that Adrienne Young did not disappoint me at all. A well-told story with a touch of magic is exactly what I was looking for.\n",

      "3.5 stars I still haven’t decided what to think about this book.The writing is gorgeous. Numerous quotes you can get from this book. Solid idea. A well architected world. Also a book that is truly about books, how exhilarating is that. ButThe pace was off. I didn’t mind the slow pace during the middle part unlike many but I’m contrast to the end, the revelations could’ve been better styled. It’s like I was running at the end from a reality to another and not in a very smooth way.The characters were decent but the romance wasn’t good. It would’ve been so much better if the link was friendship and then later on a romance developed. I won’t say much about this because it’s linked to major spoilers but the idea remains that it wasn’t well executed. Or even needed.\n",

My only complaints - sometimes there was more telling than showing. I wanted more on page time of Vis and his friends because I loved them together. and I thought the romance was unnecessary and kind of bland. But seriously, everything else is brilliant. I never once saw any of the plot twists coming. So so unique and my brain is in a puddle after that ending  exploding_head  like, WHAT?\n",

      "Hands down my favorite fantasy read of the year so far! I loved every single second of this book. I can easily see this being my favorite book of the year. If you love magic schools, stories of rebellion, a tightly-paced plot, high intrigue and original world-building, you need to pick up The Will of the Many! I will admit the story does begin like many other fantasy/sci-fi books I have read, including the Red Rising Series by Pierce Brown. Vis, an orphan with many secrets, catches the eye of Ulsicor Telimus, a high ranking military senator. Telimus adopts Vis, not out of the kindness, but because he wants Vis to help him infiltrate The Catenan Academy, a school run by Religion where the highest ranking students learn to become leaders in the ruling class. But the story quickly becomes it’s own unique world. Along the way we learn more about Vis’ past, about the world of the Hierarchy and the mysterious history of the pre-Cataclysm.The friendships Vis develops along the way gives this story so much emotional depth. I absolutely adored the friendship dynamics between Vis and several characters he meets at the Academy. It swept me up in all the feelings! Not one was I ever bored while reading this book. The pacing was immaculate! Every chapter held intrigue, twists and turns were everywhere, and every chapter I learned more about both the world and the characters. Not one scene was out of place or used as filler. And that ending? What? I have never needed to read a sequel more than when I finished the last chapter of this book. For as expansive as this world already is, we have only scratched the surface of what we’re about to learn. To say I’m excited to read The Strength of the Few next year is an understatement. It’s easily my most anticipated book for 2024! *Thank you to NetGalley and Gallery/Saga Press for a digital arc. All opinions are my own.\n",

      "I enjoyed Saint’s previous two Greek female-centered mythology retellings, Ariadne and Elektra—she’s no Madeline Miller, but she’s worlds better than the hack that is Natalie Haynes. Unfortunately, the Argonautica is the most boring and frustrating quest in all of Greek mythology, and Saint’s nice prose and feminist spin just weren’t enough to make this an engaging read.Atalanta is born to the King of Arcadia—he wanted a son, so he orders his infant daughter to be left to die on a hillside. She is raised by a mother bear alongside her cubs instead, under the protective eye of Artemis. The goddess takes Atalanta under her wing once she gets older, teaching her to hunt in her sacred forest, surrounded by nymphs. Atalanta is fully devoted to her, so when Artemis asks her to join the quest for the Golden Fleece as her champion, she doesn’t hesitate, and leaves the Arcadian forest behind to join the best heroes Greece has to offer… but the hardest part of the quest will be to prove her worth to her fellow Argonauts, who look at her with disdain, simply because she’s a woman who dares to see herself as an equal in a world built for the glory of men, a world in which women are supposed to be nothing but nameless footnotes. \n",
      "“Innocent lives, women whose names would never be remembered like his, sacrificed in the flames that forged a hero’s destiny.“\n",
      "This is just one in what I feel is a recent surge of retellings of the Argonautica, and I just don’t understand the appeal of this quest in particular: Despite being about a literal boat-full of the greatest Greek heroes, there’s no heroism to speak of going on, which makes this the most exasperating of myths: Jason is useless and obnoxious (it’s very telling when you want a quest to fail because its leader is a dickhead, and also when Heracles is one of the more likeable characters), and none of the heroes really contribute anything to win the Golden Fleece—it’s Medea’s magic that ultimately helps them get it. There are no heroic battles, not even one of wits (Jason’s too stupid for that)—they steal the Fleece through a witch’s tricks, and flee.Of course, I knew all this going in—it’s always been my least favorite Greek myth. I was hoping that Saint would manage to make me see the quest in a different light by writing Atalanta back into it, but instead, she only reinforces all of my qualms by having her heroine spend the whole voyage complaining about precisely the same things! I may have felt vindicated, but that alone doesn’t make for a worthwhile story. The quest for the Fleece only takes up about half of the novel though—after it is concluded, we follow Atalanta and a few of her fellow Argonauts to Calydon, to slay a boar Artemis has sent to ravage the region. The boar is slain, but at what cost—Atalanta is forced to slink back to the edge of the Arcadian forest, forgotten and exiled by Artemis, until word reaches her that her father the King has heard of her feats, and wants to recognize her as his heir…Atalanta’s name may translate to “equal in strength”, but her story, written by men, is frustrating, because equality is denied to her at every turn—her feats are either downplayed, not recognized, or flat-out forgotten. Saint walked the line between staying true to the original myth and imbuing it with modern feminist sensibilities very well; I especially appreciated her take on Atalanta’s final punishment, which twists it into her gaining ultimate freedom from Greek society’s restricting mores instead. While I can't say that I exactly enjoyed reading this, I do want to recognize Saint's effort: She certainly did the very best she could with the source material; it’s not her fault that the Argonautica doesn’t appeal to me, so another reader’s mileage will undoubtedly vary. \n",

      "In a Nutshell: Disappointed! There’s a plot in here somewhere, but it’s tough to locate it amid the extensive purple prose. Liked a few of the writing flourishes, but not the book.Story Synopsis:A few years ago, an unnamed man married Indigo Maxwell-Casteñada, a beautiful, wealthy and mysterious woman. Theirs was a quick relationship, with Indigo readily giving him her love on just one condition – that he never pry into her past.When Indigo learns that her estranged aunt is on her deathbed, the couple rush to her childhood home, known as the House of Dreams. Within this huge mansion lie plenty of secrets, and the man finds himself unable to resist the urge to know the secrets of his bride. Will his curiosity end up destroying his marriage, or his own life?The story comes to us in the first person perspective of two characters, one of whom is the unnamed man who is referred to as ‘The Bridegroom’. Where the book worked for me: smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  The author has a wonderful knowledge of fairy tales and lore, and her vocabulary is excellent.  smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  The book represents toxic friendship quite well. This doesn’t make the characters easy to like, but their motives comes out decently. smiling_face_with_heart-eyes  The cover is a treat to the eyes! (Both covers actually: I couldn’t decide which cover I liked better: the US edition or the UK one.)Where the book left me with mixed feelings: neutral_face  As a Gothic novel, the book needed to have an intriguing house, and it scores high on atmosphere with the House of Dreams, and even the Otherworld. Unfortunately, the house is used more like a background prop than as a character unto itself. It is personified but not utilised to its potential. What was the point of it? (The House kept reminding me of the delightful house from Keeper of Enchanted Rooms by Charlie N. Holmberg. How I missed the same effect! This one felt forced in comparison.) neutral_face  The writing is quite beautiful. Many lines were striking. However, the ornateness of the flowery text bogs down the story as well as the pacing. There’s no balance between the two crucial elements of plot and prose.  neutral_face  There is plenty of foreshadowing in the woman’s pov, which works at times but also irritates an equal number of times.  neutral_face  The big reveal is easy to spot if you are paying attention. It is hinted at regularly. The ending was good, but as I had seen it coming, it was not as impactful for me as it could have been.Where the book could have worked better for me: unamused_face  The plot begins with the idea that the bridegroom met Indigo when he was searching for a 13th century grimoire. The grimoire isn’t mentioned at all after the first chapter! Did he just forget about it? unamused_face  The couple meet, get attracted to each other, and marry within the first couple of chapters. This is one of the most rushed “romances” I have seen in fiction, especially as we don’t even know what X-factor brings the two of them together except that each finds the other attractive.  unamused_face  Of the two character perspectives, the author was clearly more invested in one and the other served only as the handrail through which the preferred plot progressed upwards.  unamused_face  The two first-person narratives don’t do the book any favour. The voice of both characters sounds the same, despite the difference in gender. At times, I even lost track of whether the bridegroom was speaking or the other character. (On a related note: the bridegroom’s pov is infused with so many emotions that it is tough to remember that we are hearing a man’s voice.) unamused_face  The writing is very slow (mainly because of the frivolous embellishments) and I had to force myself to continue. My head refused to co-operate and kept wandering outside the realms of the plot. unamused_face  Characters are exotic for the sake of it. We read a little about their different skin colour or their appearance, but their actual ethnic origin is never revealed. It's so tough to visualise characters when they are written like this. unamused_face  The author has a fondness for certain words and they pop up in the narrative time and again. This needn’t be a big word. Even something as simple as ‘lips’ gets a regular appearance. (Quick Question: How many times can I tolerate characters rubbing their thumbs over another’s lips?Answer: Zero.) unamused_face  There are plenty of references to fae elements in the plot, but we never know whether they were actual or just in the imagination of the characters. Quite a lot is left unsaid. I had expected far more from this author because I have heard so much about her Aru Shah series, though I haven’t read her works yet. This is her debut adult fiction, so I am unsure if this had her typical writing style, or if she goofed up in her writing methodology in a quest to cater to her adult audience. Either way, I might still try her works in future, but will restrict myself to the children’s fantasy titles. This one gets a no-no from me. However, if you are the kind of reader who loves lush prose even at the cost of a coherent plot, you will certainly want to give this a try. I hope you do. A majority of readers did love it. Will work if you are looking for a dark romance or a gothic fantasy. Won’t work as a mystery-thriller, as some readers have erroneously tagged it.2 stars.My thanks to Hodder & Stoughton and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Last Tale of the Flower Bride”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book. Sorry this worked out so poorly.———————————————This would have been a DNF had it not been a buddy read with Srivalli. (Do check out her review too once she posts it.) It helped to have someone to push me to the finish line. Her feelings are pretty much the same as both of us expected a lot more from this reputed Indian author. Oh well! Maybe the next BR will bring us back on track, Sri. Fingers crossed! Don’t want a hat-trick of flops. ———————————————Connect with me through:\n",

      "it kinda blows my mind how a book about an unhinged, toxic, obsessive girlhood friendship with sapphic undertones is being sold as a 'darkly romantic' story about a troubled marriage instead. trust me when i say the blurb is so misleading - there's barely any romance here and the marriage with all its secrets is the least interesting part of this book. i think if the marketing was more accurate and i went in with the right expectations, i would've appreciated the book more. because there's a lot to like here - the writing is incredibly atmospheric with lovingly rendered gothic and dark fairytale vibes. i enjoyed the coming-of-age childhood friendship flashbacks in which the two girls play games that blur the lines between fantasy and reality, it often reminded me of bridge to terabithia. their dangerously codependent relationship and collective spiral into delusion was a fascinating train wreck to witness.however, while the writing style is beautiful at times, it's equally annoying and hilariously melodramatic at times. i'd be highlighting lines in one chapter and rolling my eyes in another. also, the husband's chapters were so frustrating - his constant musings on fairytales got old after a time and his marriage with indigo didn't make me feel anything. honestly, his character exists just to drive the plot forward which means he doesn't have much of a personality - and since the plot builds up to an extremely predictable plot twist, his chapters weren't that exciting to read. i wish this book was just about the girls instead (although i admit their characters could've had more depth). despite my complaints though, i'd still recommend the last tale of the flower bride for what it gets right: the gothic fairytale atmosphere and the dark, bittersweet coming-of-age tale.ARC received from netgalley in exchange for an honest review\n",

      "This is the kind of divisive, polarizing book that people will either love or hate. I can easily imagine someone writing a scathing critique of the overwrought prose, melodramatic dialogue, and ridiculously over-the-top narrative elements. However, that someone is not me.Reader, I loved this book. I first read it over two years ago, long before it was even announced to the public. I went into that early draft with no expectations at all, which is probably why I ended up enjoying it so much. In my opinion, marketing this as a fantasy novel was a mistake. This is a gothic thriller inspired by classic fairy tales and centered around two toxic, obsessive relationships: the marriage between an unnamed male narrator and an enigmatic heiress, and the friendship between said heiress and her childhood best friend, now mysteriously disappeared.I think the main reason I enjoyed The Last Tale of the Flower Bride is its intertextual nature. Right off the bat, Chokshi makes it clear that she’s drawing from and referencing the work of other authors, from Angela Carter to Daphne du Maurier. Not only is the narrator a folklore researcher, he’s also obviously meant to be a gender-bent Bluebeard protagonist. The characters openly discuss fairy tales and mythology, playing with metafictional ideas and trying to incorporate elements from the stories they love into their lives. This isn’t always done gracefully—a lot of the time, the references feel heavy-handed and almost forced—but I enjoyed them nonetheless.Ultimately, I think this was due to the fact that the author’s literary taste seems to overlap almost perfectly with mine. I too love analyzing folk tales, picking them apart to find common tropes and dynamics across different cultures. I, too, love gothic novels about terrible women and their not-quite-sapphic relationships. For the love of a good, thrilling, campy gothic, I’m even willing to put up with a heavy dose of purple prose and melodrama. If anything, I’m disappointed this book didn’t lean even further into its premise: I would have loved a more thorough exploration of the implications of a gender bent Bluebeard retelling, or a deconstruction of the class, gender, and colonial foundations of the gothic genre. But I guess Chokshi was never interested in any of this. She wanted to write a fun, commercial novel based on her favorite classics, with a compelling villain and a love story you could root for.Which is partly why this book doesn’t really hold up under scrutiny: gothic novels and cautionary tales about murderous husbands don’t usually lend themselves to romantic happy endings. If they do, they make a point of defanging the husband in question, as a way of reassuring their (primarily female) audience that he doesn’t pose a threat to the heroine anymore. But by swapping the gender of her characters, Chokshi subverts this traditional power dynamic without replacing it with a new, more interesting one. Gender-bending a narrative structure that was created to make a point about patriarchy doesn’t work thematically, unless you substitute patriarchy for an equally compelling power structure.But The Last Tale of the Flower Bride is not trying to be thematically resonant. It wants to entertain you, and in my case, it did. So I’m choosing to avoid looking too closely at its flaws, and be generous with my rating. After all, I haven’t stopped thinking about it since I first read it years ago, and that must count for something.\n",

      "My complete review of Witch King is published at Grimdark Magazine.Witch King is the new standalone dark fantasy from acclaimed Murderbot author Martha Wells. Witch King marks her much-anticipated return to fantasy after completing her Books of the Raksura series.Kai, the eponymous Witch King, is a powerful demon with a necromancy-type magic enabling him to occupy the bodies of deceased mortals. As the novel opens, Kai slowly regains consciousness to find that his mortal body has been murdered and his spirit is imprisoned in some sort of water cage:“Waking was floating to the surface of a soft world of water, not what Kai had expected. Reaching out in that darkness, he found a cold, black sea ebbing and flowing, dropping away like a tide rolling out. Something was wrong with his body, everything was impossibly distant.”Witch King alternates between two timelines. In the present day, Kai tries to piece together the puzzle of who betrayed him. The present-day timeline is interspersed with chapters from the past, showing a more powerful Kai imposing his will on the world. Clues from the past timeline help to inform the reader about the present-day narrative.Kai is a fascinating character who exhibits a wry sense of humor, making Witch King fun to read in places, such as in the following exchange:“I didn’t know you were a…demon.”“You idiot. I’m the demon.”Despite these humorous moments, most of Witch King is a dry read that fails to establish much meaningful connection to the world or characters. Although Kai exhibits sparks of charisma, the other characters mostly fall flat.Martha Wells’s writing is solid, but Witch King suffers from slow pacing and a dense, disengaging style that makes the book a struggle to read. As a result, I never felt fully invested in the story or characters.There are hints of great worldbuilding in Witch King, but unfortunately it is never fully developed in a satisfying way. Martha Wells drops the reader into the world at the beginning of the story, but her approach generates more questions than answers. Overall, the worldbuilding feels surprisingly shallow, and Witch King proves to be an unnecessarily challenging read where the payoff is not commensurate with the effort involved.Despite its intriguing premise and flashes of sardonic humor, Witch King fails to deliver a story with enough depth or emotional connection for me to care as a reader. Grimdark readers may want to skip this one and read some of the author’s back catalog instead.\n",

      "This is a very different kind of book to the Murderbot series, just to get that out of the way. There are flashes of a fabulous, dry humor, and there's a wonderful found family at the center of this book, but the story itself is so much bigger than Murderbot, more distanced (to begin with) from its main characters, and far more time-spanningly epic - and I ended up loving it SO very much, in an entirely different way.This story takes place over two time periods: first, the present, in which Kai (the famous or infamous demon \"witch king\") wakes from a near-fatal attack to find himself and all of his closest, oldest friends imprisoned and in desperate danger. He works to save his found family (and collect new members) with all the power and wit he's developed over his vast span of lived experience - and in the past, we see exactly how he became that way (and start to guess at which ancient enemy might be behind his new trauma). It's all vivid and exciting and interesting, full of peril and intrigue, hugely imaginative worldbuilding and fabulous characters, but because so much of the first half is a slow unspooling of exactly who and what Kai actually is, I felt a little distance from all the action. I enjoyed it without being totally compelled by it. However, once I hit the middle, it all came together perfectly and I absolutely devoured the second half of the book, 100% immersed and in love with all of it (so in other words, that technique really worked!). I don't know if this is planned to be standalone or the first in the series - the ending of this book is lovely as it is - but I would absolutely love to read more books about Kai and his chosen family. I loved every one of the members of it and would love to see what happens next for all of them!\n",

      "Disclaimer: ARC via Netgalley.\tCherie Dimaline’s latest, Venco, is a book about witches. It also might be the first in a series. I have to admit that I was somewhat unsure if I wanted to read the digital ARC that was offered to me. There was something about the description that made me pause, it almost made Lucky, our heroine sound uninteresting. \tLucky St. James is anything but uninteresting.\tDimaline’s book is at first plush a mid-life coming of age story about a young woman who discovers that she is a witch and must work with the found family she gains upon this discovery. Lucky has problems, like most of us. Her mother died when Lucky was young, and currently Lucky must take care of her paternal grandmother, Stella, who is a lovely woman who is slowly losing her mind. \tLucky is a character you can’t help but root for her because she is messed up in a totally normal, everyday way. But she doesn’t wallow in the unfairness of her life, not really. Angry about it, yes, but she does not go “oh woe is poor me”. She thinks and grow, and this is important.\tOne of my “complaints” if that is the right word about Marrow Thieves was that it was very male focused, Venco is women centered and focus, connecting women from a variety of backgrounds. It is an intersectional feminist novel. \tOne of the things that stands is out that the cast is diverse across the board. The women that make up what is Lucky’s Coven comes from all walks of life and different backgrounds, and trans women are women in this novel unlike some other examples I could think of. It is important because of the acceptance that is showcased in the book. When Lucky is told that Freya was not always Freya, Lucky’s reaction is simply that Freya has always been Freya. It is great that in this book people are just accepted for who they are. \tSome people might think or even claim that this book is anti-male because the villain is a man. But this would be incorrect. While the Coven is female and the book focuses on the treatment of women by men (we are all the witches that survived type of a thing) there are male characters who help and are wonderful. What I particularly liked about the villain is that Dimaline sets him up so that while you don’t like him, you can also see him as a product of the system as well. Additionally, she is playing with the idea of women as tempter, an idea that was used to condemn witches. Her inversion of it in the story is quite nice.\tI particularly loved the fact that the maternal line and women of the paternal line are seen as equally important in the book. Too often in such novels it is the main character’s mother’s side of the family that gets the only magical focus. Dimaline reminds us that we have women on both sides of the family tree, even while showing us the lovely nature of Lucky’s relationship with her mother.\tThere are some passages in the book that are downright beautiful. There is one early on when Lucky is working home that is so magical.\n",

      "Lucky St. James is not in a good place. She's bored with her dead end job, and she and her loving but not always present grandmother Stella are soon to be evicted from their tiny Toronto apartment. One night, she finds a strange silver spoon, which has a witch and the word SALEM etched on it. This discovery catapults Lucky into a world where there is a network of witches throughout the world, and the witches of North America are worriedly awaiting the reveal of a new witch. There's also a ticking clock, as this new witch must be revealed soon so witches can begin to deal with various disasters, such as climate change.Lucky, who is Metis, already is familiar with the idea that the unusual can coexist with the mundane, but is surprised when she is contacted by one group of witches, and told she must locate the next spoon and the witch to whom the spoon belongs.At the same time, an old and evil adversary named Jay Christos (whose name is a little too on the nose) is alerted when Lucky finds her spoon, and begins looking for her and the next witch and spoon, so he can eliminate the particular coven that has reached out to Lucky, as well as prevent witches from ascending into a new level of power across the world.I like a road trip novel, especially one that's paired with a fetch quest. Cherie Dimaline has created a fun story with a sympathetic protagonist, who is inducted into an expansive community of witches. She also comments on how misogyny has affected women who are a little bit different, or noncompliant, throughout the centuries, while also crafting interesting narratives for each of the women in the coven that supports Lucky and her grandmother. The story has scenes of violence and humour but depends primarily on the central relationship of Lucky and Stella to keep you reading while the two women travel through the US on their scavenger hunt. There are few big moments punctuating the narrative, but there is suspense as Jay Christos dogs Lucky's path. Lucky grows a lot over the course of her journey, to the point that she can confront Jay, leading to a satisfying conclusion. Overall, I'd say I liked this book, and Lucky in particular.Thank you to Netgalley and to Penguin Random House Canada for this ARC in exchange for my review.\n",

      "I can now say with the utmost confidence that T.J. Klune has the gift of making me feel too many feels with his heart-wrenching and moving prose - In the Lives of Puppets is no exception and the certified proof of that. An homage to Pinocchio, a testament to humanity and all the possibilities that we have yet to overcome and achieve - this book was so very gripping, so lush with detail, so intimate in its character development, so very profound in making me think. I feel that there is such a sadness, an almost innate pitiful loss Mr.Klune has against the world - how he tries to evoke that feeling in his writing - as if he's upset, almost admonishing us that we're not doing all that we can do with our limitless potential. Which, in turn, he did cite it in his Author's Note - the story, itself, is very reminiscent to Pinocchio - the little quotes from the original story and Disney cartoon was such a beautiful touch, and the plot flowed so perfectly. There were such subtle nods to the original details, yet with a creative albeit scientific twist that made me smile - made me cry - made me hurt - the vividness of urgency for all that transpired on their journey to save his father - the desperation that clung to Victor as he attempted to make sense of everything that was happening, all the lies that he had been told about his life - it was so achingly raw and I breathed those words with such intense longing. But, what about the plot, Amina? What about the characters? Aren't you going to talk about those? Well, if you've grown up watching Disney's Pinocchio, if you're familiar enough with the characters - then this will be a treat for you, and honestly needs no explanation - save that it is all that the original story was - but with a unique futuristic spin to it. And with the light references to a few key points that stood out for me and my memory - 'the fox and the cat' made me chuckle, the Coachman was a clever idea, the floating whale was a chilling touch, the Blue Fairy was gifted with such a haunting yet chilling sadness and the other characters - I just don't know how to tell you about them.  two_hearts  two_hearts  The gift Mr.Klune has - to present his readers with such a limited cast and make them come alive with their pure essence of 'found family' thriving within their interactions - how many iterations, or as best described - “In all my days, in all my travels, I’ve never come across a more foolish bunch. And I think it fits. Humans were foolish. Careless. Cruel. But only a few. Most were full of light.”How many deadpan jokes of Nurse Ratched - a true Queen in every aspect - can I share with you for you to appreciate the protectiveness, the guidance, the resilience she mastered in supporting her team, and in her own way, loving and nurturing Victor? How can I explain Rambo the vacuum - oh, so innocent, oh so true, oh so determined and friendly and just so full of feelings despite not having any feelings at all? How can I describe Gio - that android who wanted redemption for his actions - who wanted forgiveness for his decisions - who searched for a way out with the Blue Fairy, who “trusted him with my greatest treasure” - who found love and acceptance with his creation, his son - “My great love. My joy. My light”- Victor?  sad_but_relieved_face  sad_but_relieved_face How will you understand HAP - not HARP, never HARP, who fell into Victor's life - who centered his world around him - who grew to love him - more human than machine, more than science fiction, but so very real - so very fresh in discovering and loving the world, but still not made for that very purpose. When he got his memory back - that scene - I teared up - it wasn't a great scene, but the wording - the imagery - that feeling of being found - of seeing it through his eyes... I'm tearing up writing it - because it's not cheesy, it's not corny - it's love - and if I'm anything, it's I'm a romantic at heart.  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face  loudly_crying_face  And to see HAP as he is, discarded and thrown away and yet still discovered and saved, one who retained all the mechanical parts, but grew to have a human heart gifted to him in such a manner“It’s yours.”“Yes.”“And you want to keep it.”The compartment slid shut. “You can’t h-have it. It’s mine. V-victor gave it to me.”It shouldn’t have affected Vic as much as it did, hearing Hap say his name. In the grand scheme of things, it was nothing. But there was something to it. It made him feel big. It made him feel small.“He did,” Dad agreed. “And I won’t take it from you. It is yours for as long as you want it. But be warned, a heart is not like the battery you used to have. It’s strong, but fragile.” broken_heart  broken_heart  broken_heart  broken_heart And how can I forget Victor - that sweet precious lonely boy, the last of his kind, the answer to saving humanity, who Gio described with such fondness -- “You were made to bring happiness. You are alive in ways we are not. You are soft and fragile. But you are complex and disturbing and sometimes foolishly brilliant.”And yet still be described in the cruelest of forms by the Coachman“He looks as if someone married robotics and humanity without any clue as to what they were doing.”Is this a way of saying of how much we should appreciate ourselves as humans? That we are more than what we look at ourselves at and it takes only for machines, our very own creations, to overpower us and take over the world, to understand our importance and significance. Victor was - he was such a human protagonist- having the story told through his eyes - his explorations, his determination, his devotion, his afflictions - from his embarrassment to discussing his sexual nature with his overly-zealous family, or from his desperation to save his father from returning to his own evil ways. Or from his unexpected feelings that he started to nurture for HAP - drawn to him, for comfort, for understanding, for that one connection of semblance he had to human features. Their love was so organic - so very honest - full of hope and desire to just be accepted as you were - as you are - no matter who you are - man or machine.  mending_heart  mending_heart  I felt it all - I lived it all - and how my heart ached, when all is said and done, when worldwide catastrophe has been averted, but the wound to the heart is the freshest of all --- “And it meant he did not remember Victor.That night, when sleep was elusive, Vic told his father, “I’ve never been more human.”“Why?” Dad asked.“Because I breathe, but I can’t catch my breath.” pleading_face  pleading_face  pleading_face  pleading_face This review probably makes no sense - but, I suppose that is to be expected, when it comes to my reviews for a T.J. Klune novel.  glowing_star Complete with his usual charm of humor that perfectly balances the rawness of intense emotion that is prevalent at the scene, often times a lot more lewd than before (but in a cheeky and respectable way!), and incredibly spot-on banter but still feel their heart-warming love and genuine care for each other. Laced with the touch of so many beautiful quotes - quotes galore that I would have highlighted so much more than I wanted, because it resonated so very much with me.  pink_heart  pink_heart  Much like his previous novels, there is that prevalent sense of longing, of this ache of what lies beyond this life and what we are in the moment - “Death … has its usefulness to the living. The moment you were born, you began to die.” He sighed. “What a lovely thought.”“Lovely,” Vic repeated with no small amount of scorn.“Yes, lovely. Think about it, Victor. You are finite. Your time is already slipping through your fingers. It creates an urgency within you. To do all that you can. To make things right. I wonder what that must feel like, to have a sense of true motivation.”“Why? It’s a flaw in the design.”As I neared the end of the story, I felt such a profound ache in my heart - as much as it was hopeful, it made me sad to think - which character was the 'puppet' that really eluded to Pinocchio in this story - that fictional puppet in a world of humans? Was it Victor - the lone human in a world of machines created by a lonely android who just wanted redemption - someone to love after he grew a conscience over the atrocities he had committed? Or was it HAP - the machine who one pure-hearted boy was lucky enough to find - a boy who was lonely in his own way, who grew up watching his father's films of love and marveling at the sights of --“People smiling and blushing when they saw each other, doing things they might not normally do, all in the name of love. He’d never had anyone to flirt with before. It sounded extraordinarily complicated.”-- and was able to breathe life into a contraption - to finally have a chance for human contact and affection that he had unknowingly been yearning for? I don't know - maybe, as always, I'm reading too much into it. All I can say is that this was, without question, a beautiful and engrossing read. I loved every minute of it - science fiction may not be my favorite genre, but the heart of the story - the characters' personalities - the wonderful and moving story - gripped me till the very end.  light_blue_heart   light_blue_heart   light_blue_heart   light_blue_heart “Be it man or machine, Victor thought, to love something meant loving the ghost inside, to be haunted by it. Humanity—that nebulous concept he didn’t always understand—had lived and died by its creations. Perhaps Victor would too, one day, a final lesson in what it meant to exist. But that day was not today.” clapping_hands_light_skin_tone  clapping_hands_light_skin_tone  clapping_hands_light_skin_tone  clapping_hands_light_skin_tone \n",

      "First, the cover is GORGEOUS. You might be wondering, \"Does the book live up to it? Are the cats actually important?\" The answer is YES, evil boss cats are indeed a big part of this book, and they are awesome. This is a fun book. I was giggling all the way through. It's not an overly deep or emotional book, but it is a wildly comedic story. This is the story of a man who inherits a supervillain corporation from his uncle. Unfortunately, the other supervillains don't appreciate this turn of events. He is quickly in trouble as the villains try to kill him and upset his plans. I think I was disappointed by the lack of true cartoon villainy. I was kind of hoping for Doofenshmirtz, but this book is more interested in exploring Elon Musk.

      "4.5/5\"A stupid villain threatens, Charlie. A smarter villain offers a service.\"Starter Villain is awesome. Its selling points include executive-level cats, awful billionaires, and vengeful working-class dolphins. A briskly paced and funny story seals the deal.Charlie’s life sucks. All he wants is to open a pub downtown, but even getting a loan from the bank seems like an impossible feat. Basically, his stray cats have better credit ratings than he does. He could pack his entire set of assets in barely functioning Maxima inherited from his father. Things are bad but Scalzi makes them even worse for him :)Charlie had a rich uncle who made billions as the owner of parking lots. Not sexy. Except, Uncle’s businesses were more…diversified. With villainy being the most profitable one. His uncle’s right hand introduces Charlie to the world of villains. Including an island volcano lair. And a lot of powerful enemies are coming for him. Starter Villain has an easygoing, tongue-in-cheek style that makes it a pleasure to read. I know Scalzi can write darker stuff, but he’s also a brilliant writer of satire. He has a clean writing style, excels in writing dialogue, and captivates readers with ease. Rather than showing off his writing skills, he prioritizes storytelling and keeping readers engaged.Charlie’s foray into super villainy makes him understand it’s more corporate than it is evil. It turns out the business is more corporate than evil. As it turns out, villains are professional disruptors who identify the need and do things faster and cheaper than governments or global companies. They even offer a subscription service. And let’s not forget about the well-kept secrets of the business - sentient cats, anyone? Scalzi’s portrayal of the supervillain business is both amusing and spot-on.The characters and their interactions had me laughing. Good guys are instantly likable and quirky. Charlie’s a bright guy, so he gets the hang of things quickly. However, as often seen in satires/comedic tales, some characters lack nuance. The bad guys have no redeeming qualities. There’s not much subtlety here, but it works for the story and its tone. Does anyone watch older James Bond movies for subtle character development? Don’t think so. We’re doing it for fun, action, and for despicable villains.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Starter Villain and highly recommend it to anyone looking for intelligent and humorous entertainment. The book is enjoyable and imaginative, but also comes with a moral lesson - be kind to cats!In short, if you’re looking for a fun and witty read that will keep you engaged from start to finish, then this book is definitely worth checking out.\n",

      "Update 5/2/23: Reposting my review to celebrate that today is publication day!Mari kneeled down and kept the sign high in the air, proudly speaking the truth. You didn’t get to have it both ways. Either we loved one another or we did not.The front of the sign read: where life is preciousAnd the back, which fell facedown when Mari dropped it, read: life is precious. And even though the men circled her, the entire stadium could see the message. And for a moment, before the producers had forced the Jumbotron cameras to black, the message had been magnified for all to see. Where life is precious, life is precious, and it dawned on the crowd, rapt and ready though they were for the doubles BattleGround match of the year, that life might not be precious here.Thanks to NetGalley and Knopf, Pantheon, Vintage, and Anchor for sending me an ARC of Chain-Gang All-Stars in exchange for an honest review.The TV show “Chain-Gang All-Stars” is the crown jewel in a barely future America’s Criminal Action Penal Entertainment program. Inmates facing long sentences can volunteer to join their prison’s team where they will fight other teams to the death. Most of these “Links” die quickly (“low freed”) but if a Link can survive for three years with approximately one fight a month (plus unscheduled melees, backstabbing teammates, etc.), they will earn their freedom and be “high freed.” Loretta Thurwar upset a Colossal in her first fight and became an instant legend. Now, almost three years later, she’s the Grand Colossal and she leads the Angola-Hammond Chain-Gang along with her lover and almost-Colossal Hamara “Hurricane Staxxx” Stacker. Loretta is just a few fights away from winning her freedom, but will she be able to survive the final obstacles in her path?Chain-Gang All-Stars is an impressive exercise in world building. Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah has presented this fictional prison program in great detail. There’s an entire system in place for the Links to acquire points they can use to buy better food and weapons, scouting reports for upcoming fights, etc. There’s the companion reality show, “LinkLyfe,” that draws in viewers by showing the Links in their daily life when not fighting. There’s also a wide collection of characters used to tell different parts of the story. We get to know the A-Hamm Links very well, and some other Links as well. But we also get to know the leaders of multiple protest groups, some of the passionate fans, and the “GameMasters” who run the program.The story in Chain-Gang All-Stars is quite good. I was absorbed by Thurwar’s and Staxxx’s dilemma, which was not resolved until the final page. I also really liked the character arcs of One-Arm Scorpion Singer Hendrix Young and the Unkillable Simon Jungle Craft. I thought Emily’s progression from horrified opponent to sympathetic fan through getting to know the Links on LinkLyfe was a very clever depiction of how Americans generally don’t think much about convicts, but become very emotionally invested through presentations like Adnan Syed on the Serial podcast (I’ll admit I am as guilty of this as the next person).Of course, Chain-Gang All-Stars is using this imagined future prison system, with its Roman gladiator/Hunger Games system of punishing prisoners by making them fight each other to the death for public entertainment, to examine America’s current prison system. The book has a series of footnotes with real-world facts, data, and stories demonstrating that the depravity and abuses of this imagined system are tragically quite true to life. The novel doesn’t provide an answer for what a world that abolished prisons would look like, and admits no one has all the answers, but it does lay out the case for how the current system is failing and requires wholesale changes. An entertaining yet also thought-provoking read. Recommended.\n",

      "He clearly felt awe and respect for these two women but also was not bothered by the fact that they lived a razor's edge from death. He knew it likely helped that they were Black women; market research found that the public generally cared less for their survival. In the centre of the complicated nexus of adored and hated, desired but also easy to watch being destroyed, it had to be a Black woman.\n",
      "This is as explosive as the cover and blurb promise and while the writing may not be the most smooth and 'literary' at the sentence level, this is literature as activism and that deserves the stars in my book. Set in a barely-futuristic America, this is like a fevered combination of The Hunger Games and They Shoot Horses, Don't They? set against a background of the US industrial prison complex as an off-shoot of corporate capitalism and mass entertainment. Inmates choose or are tortured into signing up for the CAPE programme where they join gladiatorial chain-gangs and fight to the death in a brutal version of a sports league complete with huge sponsorship deals and crowd favourites. But the fantasy is built on a solid foundation of facts about the US incarceration system and the 'justice' that condemns huge multiples of Black men to imprisonment, solitary confinement and state execution. The multiples of Black over white women imprisoned are less stark, but the shock is that 85% of women in prison have experienced some form of sexual violence. The story incorporates, as an example, a child prostitute of 16 given a life sentence for killing her rapist.The book does a good job of interweaving a plotline that is always journeying to a defined climax with the political commentary and a more philosophical way of understanding the prisoners themselves, most of them murderers, some of the men also rapists. There is an especially potent strand of love as resistance that threads through the story and repeated instances of the idea of freedom through chosen death. The whole thing makes compulsive reading not least via the engaging figures of Loretta Thurwar and Harmara Stacker, two 'queen' gladiators and lovers who command respect and a kind of twisted love from their hordes of fans... who also can't wait for the excitement of seeing them die. Weaving together strands on how race intersects with the criminal 'justice' system, gender and violence, perverse cults of celebrity and the late capitalist commercialisation of everything where brutal death is the ultimate reality show that also makes billions for its organisers, this is an exciting 'now' book. The ending is a little psychologically opaque but this is nonetheless bracing and stirring.Thanks to Random House, Vintage for an ARC via NetGalley\n",

      "An ambitious debut novel from the author of  Friday Black, a short story collection which I greatly enjoyed.Set in a futuristic/dystopian United States (sadly not too much different than our own), there is a program where imprisoned people can agree to fight to the death, gladiator style, for their freedom. If they survive 3 years on the circuit, they are free (or 'High Freed', as they call it, as opposed to 'Low Freed' a.k.a. dead). Loretta Thurwar is nearly High Freed. She is nearing the end of her tenure on her Chain, but after the sudden and unexpected death of a fellow Link while not in the games, things start to shift and unsettle around her. Her lover, Hamara \"Hurricane Staxxx\" Stacker, and fellow Link is also slowly working her way up the chain of command. Throughout the story we hear from these characters, as well as other characters including rabid fans of the Chain-Gangs, protestors of the program, and other imprisoned people who undergo physical and mental torture that drive them to seek freedom in the brutal sport.Like I said, this is a highly ambitious novel. It's parts Black Mirror and Hunger Games, and the author does A LOT of world-building. But it's the kind of world-building that is not always explicitly told to you. You are thrown in and begin, somewhat, to grasp the concepts over time. I think the ideas he is exploring in this book are important and the way in which he does it, by creating this alternate but scarily believable world like ours, is effective.However, I found the writing itself, and the jumping constantly from perspective to perspective without a clear structure, to be jarring and frustrating for me. I fully admit, my rating is based on personal preference. I found this concept and world-building to overtake the characters themselves, especially with SO many different 'main' characters to keep jumping between. I appreciated this speculative writing more in his short fiction, which I think just works better for me due to its brevity and less of a chance of getting lost as the story goes on.I can see why others might love this book a lot. It has a lot of great elements, and I think he does it well enough; it just wasn't a home run for me.\n",

Dnf at 60 ish % but i skipped through a fair too in places.The first chapter was so promising it really pulled me in. A kind of death race/gladiator/running man mix and i was excited to see what would happen!My issue was that i didnt feel much for the characters. The two leading ladys were interesting and it had its parts where i enjoyed. I felt there was too much back story. It went on a bit longer than needed i felt. It could have been maybe 100pages shorter for me.Idea behind this was great. Death scenes and explanation in the chapter was faultless.

It's a post-apocalyptic world (global climate change, not a pandemic), and yet an undercurrent of hope streams through the story. We watch Wanda -- named for the hurricane during which she was born -- endure losses that would finish off a lesser soul, and face the ever-changing world. The book is set in Rudder, Florida, and little by little (and then all at once) the peninsula (and social services and civilization), begin to sink beneath the rising tides.

      "Wow! Just Wow! 5 big stars of Wow!Dystopian? Not in my opinion, because what is described in this extraordinary novel is already happening. Like many of you, I always thought climate change was years off, after my time on earth is finished, but it's happening right now, and this book tells us why, and how, how easy for us to pretend that tomorrow will be just like yesterday, with air conditioning and electricity and jobs and food and stores........\"They had all hung their hats on the question of proximity. Yes, it will be bad, they said to one another, but we have years. We have time. Somehow we'll solve this along the way.\"Wanda is a child born during the hurricane she's named after. Her father is a lineman in Florida who works to keeps the power on with an ever worsening and disintegrating power grid. We get no dates here, but not too many years in our future. The storms are constant, the heat unbearable, the water is rising and reclaiming the land. Their neighbor Phyllis is a scientist and college professor who sees what is coming and prepares as a survivalist.That bare bones plot description doesn't even begin to prepare you for the twists and turns you're getting yourself into when you pick this one up. Or the love you will feel for these characters. Or the fear in the pit of your stomach as you recognize scenes on the evening news right now.I was turning pages like a maniac in the first section entitled Power. It slowed down a bit in the second and third parts, Water and Light, to the point that I could at least go to the bathroom and grab a bite to eat. I was too worried about what was coming next. The last section, Time, gives us a bit of redemption: precious little, in fact, but it may be all we're left with in the end.\n",

      "This was a well written, thoughtful story of what the future might look like if we keep doing what we're doing now but it ultimately left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I have a lot of thoughts about this but I'll limit myself to just a few. (Looks at very long review, shakes head at myself.)The thumbnail of the plot is the richest tech billionaires plot with each other to prepare for an apocalypse. They don't know how this apocalypse will manifest just that in their estimation it is inevitable and they want to be sure they are the ones to survive it. To that goal, they use resources within their vast organizations and tech they acquire from absorbing young start up companies. If you look at it a certain way, it is a heist story.It is one of those books which is mixed media: traditional narrative, text messages, online forums, news reporting. I thought this was handled well and was especially effective in the audiobookTrigger Warnings:Suicide and attempted suicideFundamentalism and apocalypse cultsDeath of parents to cancerFoster careTerrorismMy thoughts, which you can skip because I go on kind of a rant:I found this story was inconsistent in tone and pacing. Example (this is in the first few chapters so not too spoilery) The early part of the book contains three steamy (not exactly graphic) sex scenes. Two are heterosexual, the other is not. So I'm thinking, ok, this is going to be a spicy book. No. That is it. If that was not going to be the tone of the book, why did the author go so hard on it? In my opinion, if you start that spicy, you better keep it going through the whole story or it just feels like an attention grab. Another example involves a character who appears in the first chapter and disappears until the last 3rd of the book. She still is a relatively minor character. Have you ever watched a movie where you can tell that a character was supposed to be a bigger part of the story but was cut to just two scenes? This had that feeling. Lastly, the representation of a particular apocalypse cult that drives the behavior of one of the main protagonists is presented as almost benign. Conservative but not really abusive. There are underplayed episodes that make it clear it wasn't so benign but they are easy to miss. In my childhood, I spent 3 years in an apocalypse cult. There is nothing benign about them. Also, you get to hear a lot about Abraham and Lot. Way more than I wanted to hear at this point in my life. Your speed may vary.Positive Representation:LGBTQ+East AsiansFat positiveSex positiveNegative Representation (in my opinion):Blacks. There are very few of them and I did not like the treatment of black women the one I hated the most was the trope of \"accomplished beautiful black woman as a replaceable trophy wife for a rich white guy\" I work in tech and, at least where I work, there are far more Blacks (both American and the African continent) than this story implies.Final thought, and this one is definitely spoilery:In 2023, in the space of one week, two billionaires died. One in the dive to the Titanic. Another in the crash of an F1 race car. This only impacted the families and close friends of those people. The rest of the world went on uninterrupted. They are not as important as they think they are.\n",

When an explosion sets them off course and kills three crew members the entire ship is thrown into chaos. They have to figure out who did it, why they did it, and how they are going to get back on course because there is no backup plan. The story alternates between past and present timelines in order to give context for the mission and the characters. Woven throughout this thriller is a stunning exploration of identity and belonging. Our main character Asuka never really feels like she fits in both as an alternate and as a Japanese American selected to represent Japan in the competition for spots on the ship. Her story was incredibly powerful and compelling. I love how her struggle was reflected in both the past and present timelines. I really love how The Deep Sky approaches the apocalyptic SciFi story. It was incredibly realistic with many issues that reflect contemporary problems and conflicts. The world is ending and the Phoenix is portrayed as humanity's savior. They are going to start humanity over on a new planet. This setup is not a novel concept, however, The Deep Sky takes a very interesting approach by showing the flaws and cracks in that plan. As the story progresses you really begin to question the Phoenix project and the motivations of the people in charge of the project. I really appreciate the nuanced take The Deep Sky had on a very interesting SciFi concept that we have seen in other places. It was a very fast and engaging read and I would highly recommend The Deep Sky to mystery/thriller readers who are looking for something different or to SciFi readers who are looking for a simpler SciFi story. As an avid reader of weird SciFi, I kept expecting the story to take a turn towards the weird and unhinged explanations. However, The Deep Sky is very much a thriller set in space. I also wished that the author had explored a few of the interesting SciFi concepts and technologies in a bit more depth. Thank you Flatiron Books for the ARC!Links to my TikTok | Instagram\n",

      "Unp de los tropos y temas más atractivos de la ficción en la actualidad es sin duda el multiverso. La posibilidad de encontrar un lugar donde tomaste la serie correcta de bifurcaciones y decisiones para tener la vida que soñaste es demasiado seductora. Bridge, la nueva novela de Lauren Beukes, se centra en la búsqueda por el multiverso de una joven para encontrar a su madre, como bien deja claro el subtítulo del libro. Una historia sobre múltiples universos configurada para explorar lo que realmente es, en vez de lo que podría ser. Todo ello acompañado de una edición, por cierto, que llega a la vez en catalán y en castellano, ambas con la traducción de Lluís Delgado y cubierta de Ricard Efa, en un esfuerzo encomiable de la editorial catalana Mai Més.Bridge, Dom y el multiversoJo, una neurocientífica compleja y descomunal, también madre de Bridge, acaba de morir de cáncer cerebral. Bridge y Dom, su amigue del alma, están en la casa de Jo ocupándose de clasificar, ordenar y recoger sus pertenencias. Entre ellas, Dom descubre un gusano de los sueños, o al menos, así recuerda Bridge que se llamaba ese ser amarillo grisáceo, bulboso y estriado que acaban de ver en el congelador. En cuanto Bridge toca una de las fibras sensibles del ser, varios recuerdos reprimidos del pasado empiezan a salir a la luz. Recuerdos que una psicóloga le obligo a pensar que eran delirios de la infancia. Y, en un arrebato, decide llevarse por instinto un trozo de gusano a la boca, lo que desata que aparezca en otra realidad, siendo otrosyós. En las condiciones adecuadas, ingerir el gusano de los sueños fuerza un intercambio instantáneo de conciencia con un yo alternativo en un universo alternativo. Es la llave que abre la puerta a otras realidades y a todas las demás versiones de sí misma.Mientras juntan más pertenencias, archivos del ordenador y entradas de diario de Jo, cada vez parece más patente que su madre, su verdadera madre, ha dejado una serie de pistas que sugieren que esta viva, escondida en otro universo, esperando a que Bridge la encuentre. Comienza una carrera contra los recuerdos de la propia Bridge de su infancia y distanciamiento maternal, pero también, contra otra persona. Una persona que también está buscando a Jo, pero por otras razones. Amber es una cazadora, una destructora de gusanos de los sueños y es tan implacable como despiadada. Comienza una carrera de busca y encuentra por el multiverso de lo más peligrosa. ¿Podría Bridge descubrir su lugar en este mundo visitando a las demás? ¿Podría su Jo seguir viva en algún lugar?Multiplicidad de voces y génerosSi has leído algún libro (y si no, corre hacerlo) de Lauren Beukes con anterioridad, sabrás que es habitual que hibride géneros y también combine voces en diferentes formatos. Bridge no podía ser menos. Un libro de misterio con ritmo de suspense que presenta elementos de ciencia ficción con pequeñas muestras de exquisito horror corporal. Así como lo hacen las conciencias de los personajes durante la novela, saltando de un cuerpo a otro, también lo hace la narrativa. Somos Bridge y un elenco de sus yo alterno en otros universos. Somos Dom mientras investiga sobre el gusano y mantiene a salvo a nuestra Bridge original. Somos Amber mientras rastreamos a los intrusos multiversales y somos Jo, a través de su diario, descubriendo que es el gusano de los sueños y explorando su pasado.Bridge es una novela que no deja de leerse a ritmo acelerado, con voces que se entremezclan en un cóctel —que nunca se siente confuso— mientras Bridge atraviesa mundos tratando de encontrar a su madre antes de que lo haga un adversario genuinamente aterrador. Lauren Beukes maneja todo con absoluta habilidad, llevándonos de una realidad a la siguiente, presentando variaciones determinantes que nos hacen saber con qué Bridge nos encontramos en cada momento. Todo avanza a través de múltiples líneas de tiempo (presente, pasado y otros mundos) que nos llevan por perspectivas entrelazadas hasta el final y dejan por el camino unos cuantos elementos de notable ciencia (ficción). Todo para llegar hasta un final un tanto apresurado aunque bastante sólido para sus personajes, con un tramo final repleto de acción pero que deja enormes preguntas para el lector, como la verdadera naturaleza de esos gusanos de los sueños.Explorándose a través de otrosyósUna de las particularidades de las historias de multiverso es que permiten explorarse a uno mismo, de cómo diferentes elecciones nos llevan por diferentes caminos. Bridge, el personaje principal de la novela, está a la deriva. Abandonó un programa de licenciatura en negocios, ahora trabaja a tiempo completo en una librería y se castiga a sí misma por no dedicarse al cine como realmente quería. Aunque actualmente, no sabe lo que quiere ni quién es. El duelo puede darnos la oportunidad de resolver nuestros problemas, aceptar la responsabilidad por los errores que hemos cometido y crecer. O puede llevarnos también a tomar decisiones terribles que afecten a todos los que nos rodean. Y esto es lo que ocurre cuando Bridge decide emprender una búsqueda desesperada por el multiverso en busca de una madre que creía haber perdido para siempre.Explorando el universo a través de sus otrosyós, es cuando podemos ver cuan rota esta realmente Bridge por dentro. Por que realmente la relación con su madre tampoco era buena, era más bien inherentemente parasitaria. Sin embargo, el gusano de los sueños le brinda una oportunidad a la que agarrarse y obtener la posibilidad de cerrar asuntos pendientes. Por eso Bridge, lo primero de todo, es una exploración del dolor y de las mentiras que nos contamos para protegernos a nosotros mismos. Pero el libro de Lauren Beukes también es una reflexión sobre la búsqueda de la realidad perfecta, es decir, sobre la imposible búsqueda de la felicidad extrema y la aceptación de nuestras propias decisiones. Y ante todo, o lo mejor de todo más bien, es que Bridge es una historia sobre la amistad. La verdadera amistad. La que nunca te abandona, te planta la realidad en la cara cuando hace falta y aunque sepa que te equivocas, sigue a tu lado. Una amistad, quizás, que nos deja la lección más importante de todo Bridge: sólo porque puedas hacer algo no significa que debas hacerlo, ni aunque sea viajar por el multiverso.Reseña extensa en el blog: https://boywithletters.blogspot.com/2...\n",

      "3.5 starsThis is like if a sci-fi thriller was set to Mitski's \"Class of 2013.\" I swear, between the beginning and end, it's like two separate books: we open on a depressed, grieving Bridget \"Bridge\" Kittinger cleaning out her mom's house after her mom died of brain cancer, and end on some mind-bending, high-stakes sci-fi adventure fuckery.Bridge is, essentially, a multiverse thriller with a surprise core of identity questions and mommy issues. Jo, an eccentric neuroscientist dead of a brain tumor, left in her wake a grieving daughter, Bridge, who has to try to come to terms with her mom's complicated legacy. Throughout her life, Jo was obsessed with a mysterious drug called the dreamworm that she claimed allowed you to step into different versions of yourself in alternate realities; an obsession that, understandably, made most people label her as insane.Bridge thought her mom was crazy too, up until she found the dreamworm while cleaning out her mom's house in New Orleans, ultimately leading her down the most mind-bending path of multiverse mommy issues. Bridge is convinced that before she died, Jo was able to switch with one of her alternate selves, so if she can find the universe she went to, she can find Jo, and get the closure she was never able to get during Jo's life in her universe.This book was, ultimately, fascinating. I was a little worried that the multiverse aspect would be a little hard to grasp, but once I got a good idea of what the dreamworm was and the kind of story being told, it was smooth sailing. I really latched onto all of the characters, from Bridge, to Bridge's lifetime best friend Dom, to the pure insanity of Jo, to the neuroscience student Tendayi, and even to Amber, the ex-marine hunting users of the dreamworm throughout multiverses. I even got attached to Budgie, a junkie alternate of Bridge with two kids and a history of a domestic abuse at the hands of a batshit crazy boyfriend. (I hated Caden, though. Caden can starve.)There were parts that stretched on to unreasonably boring lengths; really, Beukes could have shaved off a whole 50-100 pages just by cutting down some of the padding. But still, I really liked a good chunk of it. It dove sufficiently into the question of \"what would I be like if this happened instead of this,\" and who you could be in alternate universes, all while dealing with the shitty trauma of a fucked up mother-daughter relationship. Really leans into the conscious action of leaning into who you are now rather than all the questions of who you could have been, and the question of deliberate action and how all the things we choose to do shape who we choose to be. Frankly, it was all really fascinating stuff that came for the throat of all my passive, paralyzing habits.Although, I will say that the way race was handled in this book was super-uber weird. Only the Black characters' races are mentioned, and never anyone else's? Like, it's always the first descriptor whenever their character is introduced, and no one else of any race gets the same treatment? Plus, Tendayi was one of the only semi-main characters to not get a POV (even CADEN got a POV!!!!) and I would have LOVED to see a POV from her! She was studying the dreamworm, falling in with this weird group of people, and we never ONCE heard her thoughts?? Lame. Boo. Hiss. Blah. Whatever.\n",

      "This is an interesting one to review because if it had been sold as YA science fiction, I would be praising it. It has a young protagonist and really reads like YA, but much better than most YA science fiction on the market. But Some Desperate Glory is being released as an adult title. And as a sci-fi novel for adult audiences, it's fine but rather simplistic and not super memorable. It's fairly engaging and fast paced, trying to tackle big themes like indoctrination, misogyny, and abuse but doing so in a fairly simple way. And while the scope of the premise is a large and interesting one, it's all told through a single perspective with a character who is not very self-aware or quick to pick up on things around her. The character work lacks the depth and nuance that I want from an adult title and while reasonably well-executed, the story is pretty straight-forward and not doing anything I haven't seen before. This concept could have been leveled up with a couple more character perspectives of different ages and personalities, deeper character work and world-building, and an ending that carries more emotional impact. As it is, I would recommend this to readers of YA science fiction looking for something a bit more mature. It would work as a sort of crossover title. Not bad, but also not what I was hoping for. The audio narration is good though. I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher, all opinions are my own.\n",

      "This is a SF novel, that starts quite ordinary but then has an interesting twist. I read it as a part of the monthly reading for November 2023 at  SFF Hot from Printers: New Releases group. The book was published in 2023 and it is a debut novel, even if the author had two very strong fantasy novellas before – Silver in the Wood and Drowned Country.The story starts with a quote from Euripides and excerpts of some alien instruction about humans, who are stereotyped as  uncontrollably violent. […] You should always keep in mind that in the humans’ opinion they are being perfectly reasonable when they attack you.. Then readers are moved to the main story. The protagonist, Valkyr (shortened to Kyr) a teen grown/bred on Gaea, a planetoid mixed up with dreadnoughts. She is one of the soldiers of Gaea Station, the last true children of Earth, for a generation ago our home planet was destroyed by alien majo species and their Wisdom cruiser, killing 14 billion people. Now a communalist totalitarian group trains genetically enhanced teens as their weapon of revenge. This version of what Westerners would probably call a fascist state, (even if it has more common with present-day North Korea and 1970s China than 1920s Italy) is a nice deviation from stories of corporate greed that are the mainstream in US/UK SF. In order to train they use agoge simulation, which initially feels like a version of Ender’s Game, but turns much more than that. Meanwhile, the alien ship is captured with a passenger abroad, Kyr gets an assignment she cannot accept, while her brother, it seems, defects to humans, who now live in peace with majo, so Kyr kidnaps the captured alien and his ship and gets to the wider world.To be honest, at this point, I assumed it would be a story of a person, who escapes her heavily indoctrinated past to come to terms that maybe her struggles were wrong. However, roughly at 40% mark there are several unexpected (by me) developments, which seriously improve the story.Overall, while there are some issues with pacing and too common trope from YA lit with teens overcoming larger, older and more experienced people, the book was a great yarn with interesting ideas, detailed characters and their development and some funny dialogues. A strong contender for the next year’s genre awards.\n",

      "Valkyr (Kyr) is a member of a group of trainees aboard Gaea Station which houses a group of militant human holdouts from the war that destroyed the Earth and most of humanity. The lives of her and her compatriots is a fascist nightmare where the best assignments are suicide missions and the worst are a hellish existence giving birth to child after child. When her brother is assigned a suicide mission and her own worst nightmare comes true with an assignment to nursery, she leaves the station with an alien prisoner and a brilliant queer boy in attempt to save her brother.That's the setup. There's much more going on and the story moves along at a cracking pace. It's quite brilliant. I would actually say that it straddles into YA territory (Kyr is a teenager), particularly during the first part where we're primarily dealing with a young woman challenging her own brainwashing. This part of the book could be written as a contemporary YA about someone escaping a cult, but once the really science fictional plot kicks in, this changes rapidly.Content warnings on this one abound: bio-essentialism, homophobia, suicide, fascisim, racism, genocide and probably a few more.\n",

      "Leckie’s Ancillary series is down in my reading history as one of my all-time faves, but it seems – at least for me, as a reader – she peaked too early. Raven Tower was one of the most boring books I’ve ever read, and Translation State shares some of its main flaws. To wit: unengaging characters; the bizarre decision to give the MCs no real emotional arcs or connection with others; an underdeveloped environmental concept; and a first-draft writing style that is so very far from the first trilogy that I can only assume she needed those ‘first book years’ to polish and hone and she’s not getting remotely enough time these days.Check it out:‘Either way, they’ll fix it and come get us.” Maybe. Sie hoped. But there was no point in thinking about that, in wondering what would happen if no one came looking for them, if no one could. If that happened, they would find out soon enough, no need to speculate. “We just have to be patient.”’I was impressed – perhaps easily so – by the gender conceit in the Ancillary series, wherein everyone is viewed as default female. There’s at least five genders at play in this book, nominated by ‘hir’, ‘them’, and ‘e’. I guess people with skin in the game in this matter will find this more interesting than I did. I’m all for neopronouns because I find the narrative use of singular ‘they’ headache-inducing, but in fact, the other pronouns also jerked me out of the reading process just as much, which I didn’t expect. I’m also not sure what the value-add was. In the case of Enae, I saw one typo that read ‘her’, and this plus the long hair in a braid and the caretaking ‘spinster’ role sie occupied inevitably lead me to read hir as female. I didn’t feel there was much substance to this world-building because the genders are so established that there’s zero obvious friction with their identification, but there’s also no gender roles issue, so it’s like … how did we get there from here? Even a passing reference to ‘in the past’ could have helped. The argument in queer fiction is that it doesn’t have to be about The Struggle all the time, but even straight romance has to deal with heteronormative dynamics on some level. I dunno. I would have found a dissection of this more interesting than the actual plot, is the problem.The plot starts with the disinheritance of Enae after the death of hir grandmother, and subsquently sie’s given a makey-upey diplomatic role. Similar to all the action in this book, Enae’s mission flip-flops between ‘this isn’t a big deal’ and ‘this is the biggest deal of all actually because otherwise there's no story’. It's like Leckie couldn't decide where she wanted her stakes to land and went for 'high AND low'. Enae gets involved with a complicated yet boring scenario in which a Presger Translator escapes their (I guess) breeding ground and two hundred years later (what) this results in the birth of Reet, who is raised human in a classic hidden hero trope. Reet meets Qven, another Presger Translator who is, going by context and actions, about sixteen years old. Qven is also a cannibal who’s vivisected and eaten thirty-seven people. There’s some scenes early on that belong way more to the horror genre, and let me tell you I am NOT here for unflagged crossovers like that. What’s most astonishing is how little effort goes into trying to humanise Qven in terms of making them an object of sympathy. I’m clearly SUPPOSED to sympathise, and root for Qven and Reet to overcome their very sixteen-year-old scruples about how the other one doesn't return their FEEEEEELINGS, but I don’t. Qven. CANNIBAL. 37 VICTIMS. You GOTTA try harder than that.‘“After tea and cakes we talk about weather, and then I tend to the plants. Would you like to see my plants? I have radishes and potatoes. And we could maybe get some others.” He looked at me blankly. “I am not a potato,” I warned him.’I take it back – Qven is more like a five-year-old. They and Reet also have insta-love, in case you’re interested. The ‘matching’ between Qven and potential partners is possibly a metaphor for rape or something, given how Qven ends up feeling about it, but mostly it’s giving big 20teens YA fantasy worldbuilding vibes. O NOES, I’M A PICK ME IN THIS DYSTOPIA! The fact that the other two alien species are, respectively, big hairy things and metal spiders, further speaks to the lack of imagination deployed in the worldbuilding. Should have just stuck to the sentient spaceships.\n",

      "2/5 EstrellasLa respuesta a las grandes preguntas de la Humanidad: quienes somos, de donde venimos, a donde vamos (si, como la canción de Siniestro Total), cómo surgió la vida, qué hay más allá de la muerte, qué o quien rige nuestras vida y nuestro destino, son algunos de los interrogantes que suelen atraerme de una obra de CF.En el caso de \"Ascensión\", a la vista de la sinopsis y de algunas reseñas que he leído, parece que el libro iba por estos derroteros y por eso me había resultado atractivo a priori.El libro empieza bien, pero a medida que avanzaba la historia, ha ido degenerando de tal manera que me ha costaba pasar de capítulo, más que a los protagonistas avanzar por uno de los páramos helados de la montaña en la que se desarrolla la trama.Todo se vertebra alrededor de una mole montañosa y helada, que aparece de la nada en mitad del Pacífico. Una vez descubierta, parece que las grandes potencias mundiales se disponen a investigar que está sucediendo reclutando equipos de científicos, eminencias en variados campos del conocimiento humano.Pero en el entorno de la montaña hay ciertos aspectos de la física que no se comportan de forma normal. El autor nos plantea una trama interesante basada en conceptos como el espacio-tiempo, las bases moleculares de la vida (ADN versus ARN), me ha sorprendido con apuntes sobre la microbiota y su influencia en el organismo humano y al final nos acaba endosando una historia grotesca en la que nuestros investigadores y expedicionarios acaban a tiros con criaturas tentaculares de 4 ojos (y no sigo que no quiero hacer spoiler).Una penita, la verdad. Hasta el final es lamentable, absolutamente falto de originalidad. Quizá el último canto de sirena del libre albedrío humano, le ha salvado una estrella.Pues me he quedado sin respuestas originales y disfrutables, que me hagan pensar, a las trascendentales preguntas planteadas....que le vamos a hacer. Cuan lejos de la sutileza y profundidad cósmica que nos planteaba el \"monolito\" de Clark.\n",

      "Exactly what I needed after a long week of studying: a slightly over the top book with sufficient suspense and supernatural events to keep me engagedNow and then I would feel out of sync with the world, as if it is some giant secret that I am not allowed into, and that I am completely disconnected with both the past and the present.Really enjoyed this fast paced book, which felt to me like Annihilation without much credible horror. Glimpses of Interstellar come back as well, and some of the musings on dimensions and free will can compete with Liu Cixin his work.Ascension is far from perfect, following Harold Turnmore through letters to his niece. He seems a disturbed man, locked in an asylum, and his story is incredible, revolving around a mysterious mountain, larger than Mount Everest, appearing in the Pacific Ocean.Sisyphus and predestination vs premonition form important themes.Besides the mountain ascent, which quickly turns out to be challenging (Things have become a little complicated) Harold is steeped in a lot of guilt about his past.The epistolary format, flowing from a brother who finds Harold in an asylum, reminded me a bit of Dracula, and feels a bit off given the super high stakes that Nicholas Binge infuses into the story (e.g. we know that Harold survives his ordeal).Deja vu’s are seemingly coming to life, there are anomalies, contemplations on religion and a a mysterious ex wife Naoko Tanaka.The vibe of predestination versus free will is strong, with one of the character poignantly arguing the seeing into his future gave him more choice about Achilles.There is no way of this mountain that isn’t up, and while this goals seems constant, people are changing.The obsession of the expeditions to Antarctica, or other rugged regions where people die trying to achieve a far flung goal, is very successfully conjured.At times the book felt videogame like, and many characters seem a bit cardboard like, but still this was an enjoyable book which raises interesting questions and themes.\n",

      "Rating: 4.35Yet another debut novel whose author shows promise by engaging the reader with one of the most unique, mystifying and unusual plots in publishing. A genre bending story that evolves like life itself.Nearly 30 years after Harold Tunsmore, an introverted, emotionally dysfunctional yet brilliant scientist disappears, his brother gets a tip that he's being cared for in a facility for the aging. The reunion is filled with questions of which most are answered in a decrepit stack of 'letters' addressed to his niece, Hattie. The story opens after Harold splits with his wife, Naoko due to his mistake that cost the life of their adopted son, Santi. A scientist, doctor and professor whose known for his paranormal research, Tunsmore is offered an opportunity to join an expedition to study the reason behind the appearance of a 40,000 foot mountain in the Pacific. Known as The Warden, the leader informs him the multi-billion dollar corporation funding the project requires specifics to be kept confidential. As bait, Harry learns Naoko is one of several members of the research group. The letters to Hattie read more like a narrative then memoirs complete with dialog and details, but its what they hold that captures the reader's attention. With backgrounds in geology, archeology, medicine, rock climbing and physics, the group Harry meets upon arrival is formidable. But the shock of the erratic emotional condition of his wife raises questions. Under strict rules and regulations, the group is given a presentation at Base Camp that the goal is to ascend to the summit which they suspect may hold the key to the mountain's appearance. The scientists huddle together and in the process learn they're have been others before them. When Harold encounters Naoko, he's shocked by her strange behavior, the first of many oddities that surface. Behaviors and emotional status of the group become erratic as they make their way to Camp 2, 3 and beyond. A physicist by nature, Harold can't help but notice a strange, unexplained shift in the time/space continuum. Seeing her husband again after his sudden departure, Naoko's love heals her behavior and she confidentially shares details of previous group members. A turning point, Harold confronts the Warden about the deception which triggers a snowball of events. With the window of time closing, the group struggles with oxygen deprivation, sub zero temperatures and violent behavior of the leaders. Harold and Naoko bond with a couple of the others are led to a dark cave for shelter and its here 'leviathan creatures' are discovered. Odd-shaped with slimy razor sharp tentacles, with four eyes in the center of their bodies, when injured bluish colored 'blood' spews from their bodies. A team member is killed by one and the Warden puts everyone on alert. While in the cave, Tunsmore notices that time appears to slow and deducts the caves are 'folds' in the time/space continuum. As they near the top, hieroglyphic type carvings in cave walls dating back millenniums are discovered and with them, questions of the origin of the mountain. Between the time/space portals, alien creatures, abhorrent team behavior and oxygen starvation, strange occurrences become the norm while members drop like flies. Momentum builds rapidly toward the end giving it a page turner feel as well. Immersive in nature, the story has a 'Space Odyssey' element and filled with unusual plot twists. Mystery, science fiction and the origins of life make for a fascinating reading experience. Highly recommended for those who seek something different.\n",

      "I’m some 400 pages into (41% of the way through) this approximately 1,000-page novel (electronic ARC) about global warming, the ruination of life as we know it, and the possible end of life on this planet. Parts of the novel are quite absorbing. Others are very instructive. As a whole, however, the novel is way overlong. It features too many characters and too many storylines spread too far apart. It needs a wholesale edit. First and foremost, I’m impressed with the level of research undertaken and the knowledge displayed about global warming and the dangers we face, as well as the possible remedies. I’m by no means an expert in this subject and I don’t know if things are as dire as the author would have us believe. However, I think I’m learning something about the science involved and the interplay between politics—both national and global—and the environmental/scientific community.For the most part, the prose and dialogue are first-rate—well-constructed, descriptive, artful at times, but never overdone or obnoxiously \"writerly.\"But no matter how good the writing is sentence-to-sentence, paragraph-to-paragraph, page-to-page, “Deluge” needs a good paring down. There are so many characters involved in so many disparate storylines that I sometimes had trouble remembering them and/or keeping them straight. Certain scenes—especially one involving a days-long meeting between eco-terrorists—were so eye-glazing that I found I was skimming.It didn’t help that many of the characters are not all that well-drawn. Some of them—especially the politicians—are stereotypical. Others are only vaguely sketched. Unfortunately, none of them are very memorable.What is memorable are some of the \"worlds\" author Stephen Markley creates. His portrayal of the political culture of Washington, D.C., with all its “politics make strange bedfellows” inconsistencies and \"politicians fiddle while the world burns\" recalcitrance, seems realistic and timely. He does equally well prognosticating what life may be like in 5-10 years: droughts, fires, floods, rising oceans, holograms, package-delivering drones, virtual reality entertainment, etc. The disasters he portrays are frightening. Hopefully, some of the problems mentioned above can be fixed prior to publication, especially the novel's length. The message \"Deluge\" seeks to bring to readers is an important one. But in its current form, it risks overwhelming or exhausting readers before they can glean that message.My thanks to NetGalley, the author, and the publisher for providing me with an electronic ARC. The foregoing is my independent opinion.\n",

      "The Deluge is by far and away the most disturbing and alarming novel I’ve ever read.  During the entire month I’ve been consumed by it, some of the superlatives I’ve used to describe it to my frolleagues (friends and colleagues) include the following : ‘Honestly, it’s rewired my brain and caused me to really reflect on some of my personal lifestyle choices.’‘You need to fuckin’ read this book!’‘It’s about climate change, but that’s reductive, because it actually contains multitudes narratively and thematically.’‘I’m giving this to you when I’m done.’‘It’s not THAT big…’The 4.22 rating it has on Goodreads should serve to strengthen my praise, and it’s been getting what seems to me pretty much universal acclaim around this here community.  So, everything is as it should be!  Except for our planet..I’m not nearly as educated as I’d prefer to be on the topic of global climate change, let alone the political and economic complexities that are involved, so I want to avoid details on that and instead try to emphasize why you should read this novel regardless of personal beliefs.  Markley gives us many specific scenarios and details focusing on what our world could be like going forward.  Some of these are real and others are manufactured, but all of it seems so very pressing for the reader.  And legitimate, believable and even, dare I say, imminent…?  We have multiple narratives that are presented in different points of view, all of them executed with crisp and incisive prose, culminating in a period of time 16 years from now.  Extremely readable and still varied nicely.  For what it’s worth, I remember thinking at some point that it seems like a nice sort of bridge between the challenging, complex, ‘postmodern’ tomes (Pynchon, Wallace, Markson) and the more popular, straightforward, accessible fiction (Franzen,Hill, Robinson).  Obviously, I was riveted, but also deeply moved a number of times.  People need to know that the book is filled with humanity, including elicitations of humor, love, unity, and deep personal reflection.     It is fiction, and I get that, but good heavens does it ever read like reality.  I believe, and speaking for others I’ve been in touch with, that this singular and masterful literary accomplishment may not get the readership it deserves because of its heft and/or subject matter.  This is a true shame.  I can’t really see it working if it was any shorter.

      "A haunting look at the next few decades if we don’t take serious action on climate change. This is not the typical climate dystopian fiction taking place after the world has changed, but is a look at all the pieces falling into place by failures of government, industry, and humanity. This is countered through the stories of climate advocates fighting for change through various means (government, policy, eco-terrorism, etc.) This book is long (almost 1000 page) and detailed (I happen to love the detailed policy and legislation discussions) but is a page-turner due to the engaging characters at the centre of the story. At first I questioned why some of the characters were needed and why some chapters were included but it made sense in the end. This could have been a shorter book but it might not have been as impactful. A fair warning that this book is anxiety-inducing but it might be the wake up call we need. It definitely shifted by perspective on some issues, particularly on the forms of climate activism, having volunteered with some organizations and having my own bias on what effective advocates look like.So, I didn’t really enjoy reading the book in the sense it provided escapism or entertainment, but I’m really glad I read it.\n",

      "Given that up till this day, it took me ages to finish The Invisible Life of Addie Larue for how boring and repetitive it is, it’s a surprise that I find myself enjoying this one! Gallant was ominously and darkly written, yet it was also warm and tender. It follows a non-verbal young girl, Olivia Prior who grew up in an orphanage before she was brought back to Gallant and uncovered the secret and the mystery of her family. This novel progressed swiftly enough to retain my attention, albeit a bit slow. It was conveyed in a suspenseful manner, and the delicate tension wouldn't deter you from continuing as that's what made Gallant so captivating. The plot was straightforward, but it can be seen that Schwab took a long span and diligence to develop the world.Also, not to spot the elephant in the room, but Gallant's strongest suit is definitely Schwab's writing style. Every word is carefully chosen, and every turn of phrase conjures up images that I am rendered speechless. I've heard many times how people called her a master storyteller but bear false witness when I read Addie Larue, but this novel knocks me props out from under. I also enjoyed the unique character that Oliva is and appreciate that Schwab didn't end up relying on the old stereotypes and tropes that frankly everyone is tired of seeing from a mute character. In fact, the absence of Olivia's voice will force you to hunt for answers outside the characters. It keeps the visual aspects of things in Gallant going strong. Despite the praises, I still find the book to be overly simplistic and uninspiring in comparison to the buzz surrounding her work. When I first read the summary, I had a different impression than after reading the outcome which pivots more on Olivia unearthing the Gallant. I also wished for the supporting characters to be given more substance, but alas was just there to fit as a piece to the story. Gallant is rich, gothic, and atmospheric. This is a work that feels almost archetypal in the style of great children's or young-adult tales, complete with unearthly drawings. The inkling of the Death as a cross-over from her other works was also such a brilliant move. It keeps the excitement if you have always been Schwab's fan.\n",

      "I think my nostalgia of loving the first few books of this series skewed my perception of the whole thing and made me think I enjoyed it much more than I actually did. Don't get me wrong, I'm still very happy to have read The Expanse in its entirety and would recommend it to lovers of space opera. It just didn't excite or move me the same way the first 3-5 novels did. Maybe I just got tired of reading so many books with the same characters and sometimes similar plotlines. It got to a point where I finished listening to this audiobook and realized that I didn't remember much that happened in it, even though it's only been a few days.It's a decent series but I'm not sure I'm going to be calling it one of my favorites anymore.\n",

      "Leviathan Falls is... difficult to sum up. The ninth book in The Expanse series has been a long time coming and stands as a remarkable achievement regardless of quality. With that said, and as someone who's followed this series from the third novel, Falls is also the most boring 'epic conclusion' to a long-running series that I've ever read. There will be unmarked spoilers throughout this review.The Expanse series has always had a few recurring issues. Uneven pacing, prosaic insights, and shallow characterization. Plots that are too thin for their word count. A feeling that the series is repeating itself, repeating itself, repeating itself. All of these are present in the final book in the series. It is somewhat disheartening but not surprising. The Corey team has a formula that's worked so well for them so far, so, one shouldn't expect them to change it--and yet...Perhaps the part of the novel that was surprising was the overall thrust of the novel and series, especially as Falls gets into some of the topics that the previous eight books have refused to really engage with--such as the Protomolecule, the mysterious builders, and the even more mysterious beings that killed them. For some of this, the Corey team has said that The Expanse is not interested in sci-fi extrapolation as much as it is human characters and relationships. But I feel that Leviathan Falls reveals that, perhaps, the Corey team simply wasn't capable of actually writing about the more esoteric sci-fi ideas in the series.The thing that struck me most about Leviathan Falls was how long it took to get moving. At 25% of the way into the novel, I jotted down a note that I was surprised how little had happened, and I am someone who has a fair amount of patience for slow-burning stories. To be completely honest, I was skimming more than a few chapters. The story is primarily split into four perspectives--Tanaka, Naomi, Elvi and, of course, Jim Holden. Colonel Tanaka of Laconia is tasked to find the returned-to-awareness High Consul Duarte and decides to focus on capturing his daughter, Teresa Duarte, to get to him. As Teresa is with Holden, known enemy of Laconia, this is a bit of a conflict. This little plot constitutes the first half or so of the book and is fairly irrelevant to what comes later. Meanwhile, Elvi's chapters consist of fairly meaningless exposition about the mysterious builders and what killed them, like it was written to give the fans something to pore over. Jim and Naomi just kind of wait for the plot to happen while evading Tanaka more through luck and circumstance than skill or planning. There are other perspective characters scattered throughout and they're all kind of odd--especially Kit.The plot kicks off about halfway into the novel, and it's actually somewhat interesting. And yet it also feels like a letdown. Unsurprisingly, High Consul Duarte functions as the primary antagonist with the mysterious consciousness-devouring 'goths' relegated to a storm in the distance. Like most Expanse protagonists, Duarte's trying to do something abhorrent in the name of what he thinks is the greater good. Unlike most Expanse protagonists, his plan is merely abhorrent instead of abhorrent and stupid, so, he's somewhat more intriguing than those who have come before.And yet he barely features in the novel. And, to be blunt, the idea of the final novel consisting of stopping Duarte feels rather weak after what the previous novels had set up. To return to the previous idea I raised--it isn't that the writers wanted to do it, it isn't that their plan ended with Tanaka snapping Duarte's neck, but that they couldn't deliver on the idea of a weird sci-fi odyssey to stop the beings from outside time and space. This can also be seen in The Dreamer interludes in Falls, which are remarkably obtuse and a pale imitation of the wonderful Investigator interludes from Cibola Burn.Leviathan Falls is held back by another recurring issue of the series--that is, an inability to take chances or risks. A clear example of this is the character of Amos. While he is one of my favorite characters, and a general fan favorite, he is a character who should've stayed dead after he was shot in the eighth book. He's practically a walking plot device in Falls, and his reveal in the epilogue is more eye-roll inducing than touching or interesting. This is part of the reason why I found Falls so disappointing. For a final novel in an epic series, it all feels remarkably safe.Another issue that harms the novel is an inability to treat the reader like they're smart, like they've read eight books of this epic and have some familiarity with the setting and events that have transpired. For a novel that should be an epic conclusion, the novel spends far too much time reiterating things we've seen before. Frankly, every major set piece within Falls feels like we've seen it before. Given that we are nine books into a series, one could argue that's to be expected, and yet...There are some big moments in Falls, however. The thing is, they feel like they've been coming for a long time and therefore some of the effects are lost. I laid down a set of predictions before cracking the book open and, checking them again now, I had a hit rate of seven out of eight. Is this bad? Not necessarily. But it comes back to that core complaint that the novel is just kind of boring. It's the last book in an epic series and it resolves, well, pretty much exactly as you think it might. There's something good in that, but there's something disappointing, too.One thing that did surprise me was how the writing had slipped. This is not usually an issue I had with these novels--the Corey team has always been consistent and competent. Perhaps it's the usual issue of experienced talent longer getting good editorial feedback now that they're successful, I'm not sure, but there were more than a few times where it felt like a chapter or scene had a perfect line or moment to end on... and then continued on for three or four more lines, really deflating the energy of the section or effect of a particular line. It was also more than a little annoying at how many chapters would retell sections of chapters immediately previous.So, what's the final take on Leviathan Falls? It's tough. Is it terrible? No. It's not a bad ending but it's also not a particularly great one. While the conclusion may make people think of Mass Effect 3, it isn't close to that kind of failure. It just needed some better planning and pacing and less aversion to risks. As it is, it's a very safe entry that will please fans without risking anything controversial or memorable.When I ended Tiamat's Wrath, the eighth book in the series, I had the distinct impression that Leviathan Falls would be rough, if only because of the sheer amount of ground it would have to cover. In the end, the conclusion to The Expanse feels like a condensed version of a story that should've been spread across multiple novels. There isn't so much the sensation of jigsaw pieces falling into place as new pieces being hastily cut to fit and slammed into the puzzle. There's a comment on Reddit that sums up the whole book and ending perfectly, I think. \"Can't go wrong with an ending that isn't an utter dumpster fire, right?\" Leviathan Falls is not a bad ending but it's remarkably only in the sense that it isn't a dumpster fire. I don't think I'll ever think about it again, and it won't be a part of the overall series that I remember fondly.\n",

      "Unfortunately, I did not love this book. It felt very similar to alot of other books I’ve read in the past - the two most prominent ones being Josh and Hazels Guide to Not Dating mixed with a bit of Beach Read… and I just didn’t feel like this was anything special or unique.I didn’t latch onto either of the characters, I found a lot of moments to be pretty cheesy, and I almost felt like the story was written with the booktok/booksta community in mind… knowing all the tropes and elements that’ll make an average romance reader swoon - and I do not mean that as an insult to any reader who loved this story - if you gave me this book two years ago, I probably would have given it 5 stars… but I’m much pickier now and this one just didn’t stand out to me as something different or original. I guess I was expecting more, idk. I also don’t think that instant attraction mixes very well with slow burn. If they are both drooling over each other from day one and there’s no forbidden aspect keeping them apart - then the slow burn just doesn’t make sense and becomes an unneeded tease. There was also a lot of side plots going on that weren’t needed or important to the story and every single time a scene wasn’t about Rosie and Lucas, I got bored.I also feel like there were a couple of missed opportunities. A big one being with Lucas and his ingury/career issue. I feel like it was there to give us a ‘damaged character’ but it didn’t end up diving deep into it. There was also a wasted opportunity with the one bed situation - plus there was no real groveling at the end (one conversation does not count - especially when you specifically point out the importance of groveling in romance books)\n",

      "Amy Bloom writes with the full bandwidth of her humanity. I’ve read and loved all of her previous books, so I had no doubt I’d feel the same about her new memoir, In Love. Fall in love with In Love. It’s effortless. What sounds like a grim topic—the “accompanied suicide” of Amy’s Alzheimer’s-stricken husband, Brian—is anything but. That’s because Amy tells the whole truth. There is no shying away from her own sometimes demonic rage or grief, including a hysterically funny passage about what she imagined her fakakta Jewish family saying as the gatekeeper at Dignitas, the suicide place in Zurich, was speaking pleasantries. There is full disclosure of her sometimes sociopathic sense of right and wrong, her crying fits, and the inability of either her or Brian to find their way out of a parking lot even before he had dementia. There is a journalist’s recounting of the difficulty of finding any help with compassionate suicide (even in states that allow euthanasia). So this book is moving, entertaining, and extremely educational, and you do not have to be interested in the subject to be swept up in the story. And, oh yes, per the title, there is love, deep love. And, oh oh yes, you feel every single thing because Amy Bloom feels it.Amy Bloom writes like a bedeviled angel. She is a self-described Rottweiler—one of my favorite breeds, powerful dogs who display their enormity in both love and protection. She is one of our greatest living American writers.***Thanks to Random House for the ARC.\n",

      "I appreciate the idea and the level of research behind this story, but sadly it failed to grab me like the other two books I've read by this author, Dark Matter and Recursion. The beginning was really strong and seemed promising, but at some point the story took a direction I didn't anticipate and, what's more important, wasn't comfortable with. The rest of the storyline didn't work so well for me, nor the resolution at the end. The middle part was slow and at times it seemed like nothing was happening. The story is very science-heavy, but more in a way that felt info-dumpy to me. It didn't help that I found Logan hard to connect with and, as the story progressed, quite unlikable. The audiobook is really good, though.\n",

      "As genetic manipulation is slowly but surely leaving the science-fictional realm and possibility of genetically enhanced humans is close enough to start raising real ethical issues (the idea of unenhanced genetically “inferior” class vs superhuman rich who can afford it, raising inequalities to cellular levels, for instance), books like Blake Crouch’s Upgrade make me consider where I’d fall on that spectrum. What would I do or want to see done? We all would probably embrace eradicating genes that cause diseases, especially in kids, but where is the stopping point? When does enhancement stop being good enough and becomes too much? And how better would the world be if we had means to fix things that cause us problems? After all, we all know humans are imperfect, so why wouldn’t you want to improve things and help fix the screw-ups we did to our world? “I had extraordinary dreams and an ordinary mind,” a character thinks. But why do we have to hang onto the ordinary? We as a society have been fascinated by the idea of superhuman, superheroes for a while - certainly long enough for Marvel to create a whole profitable universe of them - but what if we had the means to try to upgrade us all?Is hanging on to the present imperfect genetic status quo really just plain old fear of changes?\n",

Saving the majority at the expense of the minority — should we be thinking individualism vs species survival? Maybe the answer will depend on which side of that divide you fall — but do you have a choice in that? And who gets to decide and police that?And can we actually solve our problems if we all were just better at being us? Would we be smart enough to stop screwing up, or would we just start screwing up on a more epic scale? Being brilliant does not after all make you any less of an asshole; it may actually have a very much opposite effect.\n",

What if you create a bunch of people who are just drastically better at what they already were. Soldiers. Criminals. Politicians. Capitalists.”\n",
      "There are no correct answers here, but Blake Crouch presents one possible scenario, and he does it well. Certainly entertaining, easy to read, very accessible, and zipping along at a frantic pace which nevertheless is easy to follow. The science is explained at a very simple level, so no genetic upgrades are necessary for it all to be crystal-clear.“I could read a book with my eyes while simultaneously listening to an audiobook, and comprehend each one to a seventy percent degree of accuracy.”Yes, please. That would make Goodreads even more fun.It’s an entertaining and a fast-paced adventure, but although I had tons of fun reading it, zipping through it in a few hours, I anticipate that it will fall out if my memory relatively fast, too. But it can make a fun summer blockbuster movie if ever put to film. And ultimately it stops short of being unsettling or digging too deep, instead feeling like an eventual comfort read. It’s language and the entire story cadence seem made for a pleasant and fast summer read, a few hours well-spent but perhaps not that memorable in the longer run.\n",

      " by Blake Crouch combines genetic engineering science fiction with a techno-thriller. Logan Ramsay and his partner Nadine Nettman work for the Gene Protection Agency (GPA). They are with a SWAT team looking for an illegal genetics laboratory. Logan is the first one in the basement. An explosion causes shrapnel to puncture his hazmat gear. He wakes up on the hospital infected by a virus; one designed to modify his genetic structure. The virus soon disappears and Logan returns to work. However, he is noticing changes. His bone density increases and he’s getting smarter with better concentration and a photographic memory. With this as a starting point, I believe it’s better if readers go into this with little knowledge of what is to come.Logan is a nice person that has had a rough time of it during the last few years, but he has a loving wife and daughter. He hates his job, but doesn’t know what else he would do. He’s the son of Miriam Ramsey who killed millions when a genetic experiment went wrong. His character experiences extreme growth in many ways during the course of book. The other characters provide support or opposition and include law enforcement, military personnel, co-workers, and family members.The story is engaging and suspenseful, keeping me turning the pages. There is a lot of information about genetics, but that is something that interests me. The plot is shocking and the action amazing. This is a science-based thriller set in the future and it has some unexpected twists and turns. My one quibble is that there is some slower pacing in the middle of the book. It doesn’t last long and maybe readers need that breather before the astonishing second half. Themes include genetic engineering, experiments, family, trust, betrayal, and much more.Overall, this was an entertaining, appealing, and somewhat scary novel when one thinks about the possibilities of what can go wrong with genetic engineering. There are some pivotal stressful and emotional times. I am looking forward to reading more from this author.Random House Publishing Group – Ballantine and Blake Crouch provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.

      "Set in the not-so-distant future Blake Crouch’s Upgrade revolves around Logan Ramsay, an agent with the Gene Protection Agency (GPA). The GPA tracks the development and application of genetic research to prevent it from being used for any purpose that would be detrimental to the human race. This is a world where the application of genetics is highly regulated and gene modification or editing has been outlawed. Though the Gene Protection Act had effectively ended all private and university-based genetic research, some scientists and researchers have been continuing their work illegally. The GPA is responsible for tracking down and arresting illegal researchers and the closure of all underground research labs/facilities.Logan’s mother Miriam Ramsay had been a gifted scientist whose discovery of 'Scythe' - a revolutionary, biological DNA modifier system, had ushered in a new era of gene editing. However, her experiments with genetic modification resulted in The Great Starvation, a disaster that led to the death of millions of people, food shortages and economic ramifications that the world is still recovering from. Since then Scythe has been deemed illegal. Logan, in the process of a raid on a suspected rogue genetics facility, is exposed to the Scythe virus. He is quarantined while recovering from his injuries and a high fever that he recovers from. When test results reveal no other effects of his exposure, he is discharged and returns home to his wife and daughter . However, as the days progress, he notices changes such as improved memory and cognition. Genome analysis reveals that his cognition, memory, concentration and pattern recognition have been enhanced among other changes happening within his body . In other words, he has been “upgraded”.Under suspicion for self-injecting and illegal use of genetic modification tech, Logan goes on the run, learning to balance and hone his enhancements while trying to comprehend the full scale implications of all that has happened . Is his exposure a freak accident or was he targeted? Who is behind this advanced Scythe-like genetic modification sytem and to what end ? Was his exposure an isolated incident or is the world on the brink of another disaster? Who can he trust to help him find the truth? Blake Crouch’s Upgrade is a fast-paced, action-packed sci-fi thriller that is hard to put down. Though some of the science might be hard to understand, that hardly detracts from enjoying the suspenseful narrative. While I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, I haven’t read much in the sci-fi genre in the recent past but I’m glad that I got to read this novel. I had heard a lot of good things about Blake Crouch’s books and now I can see why. This was my first Blake Crouch novel and I look forward to reading more of his work.\tThanks to NetGalley, Kathleen Quinlan and Random House for the digital review copy in exchange for my honest review.\n",

      "Dangerous Rhythms chronicles the symbiotic relationship between jazz and the shadowy underworld of gangsters. Beginning with the music’s origins in the streets and bordellos of New Orleans’ infamous Storyville red light district, the book traces the tale of how jazz and organized crime grew and developed together. From New Orleans to Kansas City, Chicago to New York, Los Angeles to Havana to Las Vegas — the hottest towns for jazz and the underworlds that both supported and exploited it are mapped out. The often arcane relationships between mobsters, corrupt politicians, and the music business is explored. The book is arranged as a collection of episodic stories, mostly in chronological order, that tell the history of jazz’s most storied performers and their dependence on the mob’s most nefarious characters. For some, it was a devil’s bargain of necessity. Others were drawn to the glamor and danger of the mobsters. Dangerous Rhythms serves as a bird’s eye history of both jazz and the mob, and will be fascinating to those interested in either.\n",

Featuring many names you've heard of, with a particular focus on the tales of figures like Frank Sinatra, it paints a pictureIn great detail, this book absolutely lives up to its title, showing exactly how the world of the Mafia and the Jazz Age overlapped. The author covers a lot about crime and political machines, rather than just focusing on music-related history. By similarly jumping between many distinct characters, the book is less a chronological history and more an anthology of jazz-tinged gangster stories. And with lots of firsthand sources and historical archives to back it up, myths are dissected and confirmed for the fans who have likely only heard some of the urban legends so far.

      "Book Reviewed on www.whisperingstories.comAfter the death of their mother, sisters Jani and Zosa travelled to the town of Durc hoping for a better life for them, but unfortunately, one couldn’t be found and they ended up working in a tannery. Upon hearing that the mysterious Hotel Magnifique is in town and they are looking for staff, the girls apply for jobs.This is a book that is hard to review without giving any spoilers away, but I will try, hence I haven’t told you any more about it above. What I will say is that it is a truly amazing YA adventure novel. It is filled with magic, mystery, and mayhem. There is good and evil both at play and characters you will love and hate.The hotel is unlike you will ever know, in that each day it lands in a different place in the fantasy world that has been created by the author. The guests pay a lot of money to stay there and are treated to the most enjoyable, out-of-this-world time whilst they are there. The staff though is a different kettle of fish and not everything is as it first seems, something more sinister is at play and Jani is determined to discover the truth.I adored this book. It is fast-paced, exciting, unputdownable, enchanting, and totally unique. The hotel is brought to life on the pages and the descriptions make it easy for you to visualise what is happening.Essentially this is a book of love, the bond between two sisters and the courage it takes to face anything or anyone, whether real or magical, who tries to come between them. It is a fabulous story and anyone who loves books filled with fantasy and magic should give it a read.\n",

The idea of a wonderous and magical hotel, with all the mysteries and lore that surround it, were so compelling and intriguing. Taylor creates a solid backdrop for her story in a magical France where magicians are feared and outlawed and an orphaned young woman is struggling to fend for herself and her sister while wanting more in life than what the dice have cast for her. Nothing extremely new, but the story itself was original enough that you can definitely say this book is its very own, and the author has a wonderful imagination.The plot was a bit slow-paced, but each chapter was stuffed with magic and wonder like an overfilled cannoli and I was never bored! Jani was a great protagonist and I enjoyed seeing her development. Bel was also cute, and their romance was sweet, if a tiny bit bland in my opinion. Another negative was that the climax seemed a bit lacklustre and coincidental, but hey, we love a nice happy ending.Overall this was a great debut, not amazing or completely memorable, but fun! I will definitely look out for more from this author! <3\n",

      "While South To America contains histories, it is not a history book. Rather, it is a guided tour of the South (particularly the Black South) by a native daughter of the region. She explores it region by region, starting in Appalachia, relating histories, folkways, foods, industries, everything that makes that region unique, and ties it all back in to race relations and the struggles and triumphs of Black Americans in those regions. The author was born in Alabama, has family roots in several of the regions she explores, and has a palpable affection for the South. This is an intensely personal book, as Perry relates her own and her family’s stories to illustrate points that she is making. It’s clear that this isn’t an academic tome but a labor of love.\n",

      "The idea of travel as a way to gain a better understanding of history and the present has been used by many books. In the hands of a capable writer, the premise delivers. \"South to America\" focuses on the South and race. In the hands of a capable writer, this book would likely be overshadowed by Clint Smith's excellent \"How the Word is Passed\" Smith's work is driven by his curiosity, thoughtfulness and desire to understand. Perry's work is dominated by her close-mindedness, scolding, and self-aggrandizement.\"South to America\" lacks any sense of coherent structure. Chapters bounce around from place to place, driven by nothing more than that's where the author happened to be for some other purpose and she decided to cram some history in. Worse still she wants to tell the reader, in tiresome detail, about the book event or cocktail party that brought her to the place.Her privilege and classism are major barriers. At one point when getting in a cab with a white driver she remarks that this is the first white person outside of a store or university that she's interacted with. She's wildly out of touch with regular people, though she never tires of telling the reader about the feelings and motivations of poor black people. What ultimately dooms \"South to America\" is that the author is temperamentally unsuited to the kind of work she has set out to do. Travel writing and getting an understanding of a place and its people requires a generosity of spirit and a genuine desire to know others. She couldn't be more unsuited to the task. At one point she's talking with a Confederate war reenactor and wonders to herself why he does this and why the Confederacy. She speculates to the reader, but never actually asks the man why.In the first chapter, she criticizes the writer Tony Horwitz for ultimately being too cozy with Confederate reenactors in his \"Confederates in the Attic\" Horwitz's open-mindedness and curiosity about others are what Perry seems incapable of and what are essential to this sort of project.The people who live on the coasts don't really understand this country because they don't get out of the big cities. They don't see what things are likely in the rural areas, in the middle of the country or the South. Imani Perry is not the guide to take them there. Read Clint Smith and read Tony Horwitz instead.\n",

      "I really enjoyed what this book was trying to do and I think there was a lot of important observations in the book that make the reader really take a look at the Southern region of America. To be honest, I have to give this just a three star rating because of the writing style. It was often confusing to follow along. It was quite dense and nonlinear; it assumed the reader knew a lot of the background information and context of historical places and events. As a Canadian I just didn't know some things and there were a lot of acronyms that I don't think were properly explained. I would have liked to have a bit more organization within the chapters. I felt like I would start reading a chapter and just when I was beginning to understand it would switch to a different topic and I could not figure out how they were related. To sum up, the content was good, however it was hard to absorb and understand because of the writing style.\n",

      "Imani Perry, a Southerner, takes a deep look at the soul of the South. The South is not as simple as those from outside might believe. Of course, there is much to criticize since it has a history of violence and abuse towards those with darker skin tones--a history which it has not entirely outgrown. The author is deeply aware of these injustices from her own personal experiences and from growing up in a family involved with the Civil Rights Movement, so she doesn't pull any punches when there is criticism to give. However, she also points out those things that comfort her about the South that she can't find elsewhere. As an expat from the South myself, this is an aspect of the book that I can identify with. What pleasantly surprised me is that this book is a lot more personal than I was expecting it to be. Each chapter focuses on a certain city or area that the author has visited, and she shares her experiences in those places, which lead to some insights on the South. This personal touch grows on you, and by the end of the book it feels as if you are listening to the stories of an old friend.\n",

      "Q:“Does this sort of thing usually work for you, insulting people you’re asking for favors? (c)Q: “He saved my life,” I ground out at her. “He saved my life thirteen times,” and I gasped on a breath of agony: I’d never have the chance to catch up now. (c)Q: The world did in fact insist on going on, and I didn’t have the mana to make it stop. (c)Q: I spent the next day sitting blankly by the dead firepit. (c)Q: I just sat around, inside or outside the yurt mostly at random, and kept trying to change it in my head, play the whole thing out again, as if I could change what had happened by finding some better set of things I should’ve done. (c)There's quite a lot of suprisingly powerful stuff in here. Parents, they always will do a number on their kids, no matter how good they are. Maybe it's all preordained?PTSD's a bitch. Poor kids. Poor Gwen. Am I the only one getting the Narcissa Malfoy vibes from Ophelia Lake?Q: She was in roughly the same state of hysteria as I’d been myself, half an hour before, but I’d had her for help, and she had me, and I’m not very useful unless you’re under attack by an army of maleficaria. (c) Gosh, poor El. I feel that.Q: I’d never imagined that Mum, of all people—who’d never let me see a monster in my own mirror, even when the whole world was trying to convince me that was all that was there—would look at Orion and see his power, and decide that he was a monster. I couldn’t bear it that she hadn’t been able to look at him and see a person. It made it feel like she was lying about seeing me as one. (c)Q:So I could have gone back to scream at her, to tell her the only reason I was alive for her to dream of was because Orion had killed the maleficer who’d gutted me, and had risked his own life spending the night in my room killing the endless stream of mals who’d come to finish the job. (c)Q:I wanted to go back to Mum, but I couldn’t, because I wanted to ask her to hug me for a month, and I wanted to scream at her... (c)Q:I don’t know that I’d even needed him to make it out alive. I had been fairly sure before we began on our objectively lunatic plan of escape that I’d end up dead myself, and at least half the people I cared about along with me, with Orion topping the likely list. If our plans had gone pear-shaped, if the maleficaria had broken loose from the honeypot illusion and started slaughtering us, and we’d all had to run for it, and in the chaos he’d been one of the people who hadn’t made it out, I think I’d have cried and mourned him and gone on.But I couldn’t bear this. (c)Q: Summoning is like make-and-mend. There’s a basic version of it in any given language, which you then elaborate on, depending on what you’re asking for and what you’re offering up in return. You can use a summoning to get almost anything you want—including unwilling sacrificial victims—as long as the thing you want exists. But you have to pay for it—and more than what the average wizard would call its fair market value. If you do a summoning and you lowball the offer, don’t put enough mana in or make enough of a sacrifice, then you lose whatever you have put up, and the summoning doesn’t work anyway.But there’s another way to cast a summoning. You don’t have to put in any mana or make an offering at all. If you don’t, if you just leave the payment wide open, you’re offering anything and everything you have, including your life. Or, in this case, offering to have one of you spend a dragged-out eternity screaming in the belly of a maw-mouth, and offering to have the other crawl out of the Scholomance gates alone and sobbing to bear and raise your child.And you’re offering up the life of that child herself. That handful of cells so completely dependent on your body that you can offer her up without even realizing you’re doing it. Making her a burdened soul as my great-grandmother colorfully put it in her prophecy, signed onto the family mortgage from birth, a vessel to be filled up with terrible slaughtering power and a hideous destiny of murder and destruction, the balance for your pure idealism. All of you paying together, just so that one day that child will earn a chance, just a thin sliver of a chance, to jump up and grab a copy of the spellbook you’re after, off a library shelf at school, to accomplish your dream of generosity and freedom. (c)Q:I suppose I’d had a choice about that. I hadn’t had to fight the maw-mouth. I could have let it go and kill several dozen freshmen instead. I could have paid off the debt of my parents’ courage with that cowardice, sending a pack of children to go down screaming into ten thousand years of hell, and set the balance right that way. I’d paid with my own screaming instead. I didn’t want to remember, but I couldn’t help it, queasy and shivering on the cot, clammy-skinned with the memory. Some part of my brain would still be screaming, still in that maw-mouth, the rest of my life. (c) Poor El. DD Jan 10, 2021 OMG, YES! I was actually scared to look at the series page to see whether #3 would be coming! It would've been totally evil to leave us hanging in the void for all eternity after that cliffy!

      "The Scandalous Hamiltons!, or \"Scand Hams\" as I call it, is the story of Alexander Hamilton's Gilded Age great grandson, who like his forebear was taken in by a comely con artist.When I first heard of the book, I was surprised that I had not heard this story before, but as I started reading it became apparent why: there isn't that much of a story here. Instead, lots of ancillary information of little interest is heaped together to try to prop one up.Paradoxically, it's a pretty good read because it's told with a lot of verve and skill and can serve as a nice escape to a different world, America over a century ago, particularly New York and Wyoming.Some disappointments:- The photos are placed too early in the book as they reveal outcomes that spoil the story.- Mentions \"Nucky\" Johnson, but surprisingly fails to mention that he was the prototype for the famous \"Nucky\" Thompson of the Boardwalk Empire television series.- Apparently the editor, and it sounds like, progenitor of the book is one Michaela Hamilton. Whether she is part of the Hamilton clan would seem of interest, but is not included.\n",

      "Cannot stress how excited I was that my store got an arc for this one. This review has no story spoilers. When I finished Xiran Jay Zhao's debut novel, Iron Widow, I took to the internet to find out when their next book was coming out. After about a half-second of disappointment upon seeing it wasn't a sequel, I read the synopsis for Zachary Ying and the Dragon Emperor, and I had the exact same feeling about the book that I'd had about Iron Widow: I'd never read anything like that before. Zhao has an incredible knack for surprising fiction, but a unique premise isn't enough – an author needs to back it up with substance and quality. Zhao has now managed this balancing act twice, with two incredible novels that really have it all. If Iron Widow is Pacific Rim meets Handmaid's Tale, then Zachary Ying might be Gaiman's American Gods meets Yu-gi-Oh, all through the lens of Chinese history and mythology. Here's where I'll stop comparing Zhao's two novels, because they really are two very different books. Like American Gods, Zachary Ying doesn't shy away from the complicated nature of a cultural identity, but Zhao's book never manages to lose a sense of optimism and pride. There's so much to say about Zachary's journey, which is thrilling enough to engage young and reluctant readers (cool superpowers, cool monsters, actually fun facts about sometimes very strange historical moments), but complex and intimate enough for advanced readers or adults who like weird fiction. I'll just wrap it up with this: It's real, real good. I was so excited for Zhao's next book, and it did not disappoint.\n",

      "I can't, consciously, give this book more than one star. I'd love to, because I've genuinely grown to love Ana Huang, but I can't.I've hidden this review because there are so many spoilers. In fact, it's better to go into this book spoiled. Believe you me. A bit of context. The relationship between Jules and Josh has been hinted since book 1, where their banter and 'hate' is an obvious throw to one of the oldest tropes in romance: enemies-to-lovers. In this case, though, Jules and Josh truly *truly* despise each other. Jules is Josh's sister's best friend. He thinks Jules is a terrible influence on his sister. When this book begins, Josh and Jules are in their usual status quo of throwing verbal daggers at each other. Life throws them together when they both start work at the same clinic and that's when they enter into the truce that would eventually lead to them being together. Josh needs therapy. Seriously. 'Book 1 Josh' is not the same as 'Book 3 Josh' and maybe this is the reason 'Twisted Hate' does and doesn't work as a standalone. If you're just reading it because you picked it up, ignoring the previous two books, you'll miss out on a world of background. 'Book 1 Josh' is very laid back, a total man-whore and pretty chill about life in general. 'Book 3 Josh' has serious issues. He was betrayed by Alex, his best friend (which, honestly, it's not that big of a deal when you think about it and considering what truly happened) and his father landed himself in prison because he's an actual psycho. Josh clearly has a huge amount of pent-up feelings that would have benefitted from a therapist. In fact, it would have been an extraordinary element to add to the story. These obvious issues lead Josh down a fucked up rabbit hole that had drastic, and I mean, DRASTIC repercussions for this book. It goes downhill at about 72% of the book. Jules backstory is revealed to be sad and pretty screwed up. She had to thieve away in order to survive when she was much younger. It's not good, but Jules escapes from that life in order to pave her own way and become someone. The fact that Jules is hiding this dark past, does not bode well considering Josh's fragile psyche when it comes to, precisely, trust issues. You can see a mile away that it will not end well and things will get ugly. Up until this point in the book, however, it's going good. I mean, yes, there's the one bed cliché and the fact that Josh falls in love with Jules in a very quick turn-around, yet I can overlook all of this. Their sex is genuinely STEAMY and those first 'hate sex' scenes DELIVERED. It was working (at least for me it was). Then, Jules is blackmailed by her ex into stealing a painting that Josh has. Now, there are a few things I'm genuinely pissed about concerning Jules. Her best friend's boyfriend, Alex, is THE psycho and I'm sure that if she'd asked Ava for help, the problem would have been solved altogether. Secondly, she knows Josh is dealing with trust issues and she decides to come up with this insane idea of staging a break-in and then confessing it was her? I expected honesty from the get-go, to be frank. Jules and Josh have always been honest with each other, if anything else (even when they hated each other). This, however, felt uncharacteristic and a bloody stupid idea. Jules was wrong, yes, but what Josh does? Unforgivable.  Unforgivable. Jules ultimately confesses everything to Josh: her past, that she'd been blackmailed, that she stole the painting and his other things, that she had brought them back and the reasons why she did what she did. Basically, she comes clean to Josh. A little too late, yet she does it anyways and that does take a lot of courage. What does Josh do? The fucking worst. He says that he forgives her, has sex with her only to tell her \"I don't forgive you. I lied. How does that feel?\" That shit made ME feel dirty. You don't do that to someone you love, let alone someone you know has gone through an inordinate amount of shit. To make matters worse he references that the only thing he'll miss is 'her pussy', which further hammers the nail into the quintessential coffin. Josh was cruel. Horribly, deliberately, cruel, to a point where *I* stopped cheering for him altogether. I read another reviewer that questioned 'consent' under this whole scenario. I'm not going to go there, but I will tell you, it was underhanded and definitely wrong. After that moment in the book, I was just focused on finishing it and getting it over. I didn't think he deserved forgiveness, especially since he didn't do much to earn it anyways (just ask her for it). Jules shouldn't have forgiven him for that shit. Also, when Jules is hurt (because the blackmailing ex pushes her down some stairs), Josh treats her (in the ER- because he's a doctor), in the most detached and cold way possible. Despite this, he goes after the ex and beats the living shit out of him. This was, apparently, the catharsis he needed to feel better about the events he'd gone through in the past two years. Dude, no. YOU NEED THERAPY (and maybe Jesus). Also, I'd like reiterate that Josh is a doctor and he's not supposed to be beating people to the point of near-death. Alex... ALEX THE PSYCHO, is the one to stop him [you know things are bad when the actual psycho hero from Book 1 (and 'alphahole') is more human than the protagonist]. So yeah, excuse me if I really wish nothing good for Josh. Conclusion. Really disappointed and sad. I had great expectations concerning this book and they went right down the drain. If you decide to open the 'spoilers' in this review, you'll see that there are legit reasons for you to skip this book. I would, however, recommend 'Twisted Games' (aka Book 2 of the series). Rhys and Bridget are a wonderful pairing and well worth the read.\n",

      "I won this book in a Goodreads' Giveaway. I loved the artwork in this book. A little drawing of something that happens or an object of importance in the chapter was placed at the start of each section. It was cool to then read the chapter and see what the correlation was between the image and what was happening next. The backstory on how the world became what it was, was amazing. I loved the thought process that went into the history that took place before we got to the present day. Not only do we have a world that is being plagued by the Great Fatigue, but their first attempt at a cure led to the deterioration of their minds. It was also clever to add in the detail of both the people of New Haven, and Seth and the Professor calling this degressive human race by different names. Since Seth and the Professor had lived separate from the rest of humanity for years, they don’t know what is going on out there or what everyone else calls these creatures.  I don’t truly understand why the Professor didn’t just explain what he was doing in his lab to Seth. I get that he was worried that Seth might not understand, but he is clearly a smart kid and it didn’t take much for him to grasp what the Professor was saying he discovered. There was clearly no need to hide any of it from Seth.  Josh was the worst character. He treated Sarah terribly. Stalking, kidnapping, sexual harassment, and when she did something that he didn’t like, he would hit her and say that it was her fault that he had to get violent. Josh was the definition of an abusive man.  The author left a few questions unanswered at the end. The one I’m most intrigued about is the belt that the Professor said belonged to Seth’s father and the story behind where Seth came from. I really hope we get a second book to help fill in these blanks.  I'm giving this book a 4.5 star rating.\n",

      "Crumbs by Danie Stirling is a 2,000 image Webtoon YA comics fantasy romance converted into a 300-page novel. I’ve read enough of contemporary romances to almost--but not quite--be cynical about the way this story uses the ideal ingredients of a hot YA graphic novel: Romance (check), between two young people of different races (check) and sizes (check) [one named Ray, female, and Laurie, male--are these folks straight, or trans? I see no clear evidence, so whatever, it's all good), written by a queer author (check), with magic (check), and set in a sweets bakery (check).I mean, what else might you be looking for in a YA fantasy romance? Maybe they could fly to Venice and kiss at sunset in a gondola under The Bridge of Sighs? But okay, it’s pretty sweet, if a little overlong for my tastes, (not that I pored long over it). Ray, a seer, has witchy powers, has a broom, and so on; Laurie is a musician (check) and barista at the bakery. Let’s see, what else: Phones have little creatures/pets coming out of them (what else might you want from your phones, right? I'll just say check again right here). What's not so great? There's some vague government mind control thing going on, with memory-erasure? I basically have forgotten it already (hey, maybe this is really happening?! What was I talking about, again?).

      "This book wasn’t exactly what I was expecting. In addition to the stories about the animals on a rescue farm in New Jersey, it's also a memoir of the woman who runs the farm. A woman whose life got off to a rough start with an abusive father. This is a heartfelt story. Zaleski isn’t a particularly talented writer. Her style is pretty basic. But the story she tells is real and engaging. After years of abuse, her mother finally leaves their father. Giving up a life of privilege, she moved into a shack with her kids. And then began rescuing a diverse group of animals. Not just dogs and cats, but goats, horses, pigs, chicken and cattle. It wasn’t an easy life but it was a fulfilling one for mother and kids alike. She was a role model for good and bad. Her horrible choice in men led Laurie to have a fear of commitment. But I loved her motto, “the more you cry, the less you pee.” I recommend this for every animal lover. It’s a reminder that everyone deserves a chance. My thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for an advance copy of this book.\n",

      "DNF 50%...real fun animal stories, but....1. The writing lacks in many ways. 2. The animal stories are about 10% of the book. The other part is about her mother and father and working and a bunch of boring situations. 3. Animal cruelty, abuse....things I wish hadn't got into my head....I do not recommend this read.\n",

      "I told myself I wouldn't cry when reading this book, and I got so close! But there was a scene at the end that put me over the edge. I rarely cry when reading books, but this one managed to get me in the end.This was a fabulous memoir about Laurie Zaleski's life, her years growing up in a family with an abusive father, her years of poverty and eventually how she took her mother's dream of running an animal rescue and made it into her own dream by buying a 15 acre farm in New Jersey. At the farm Laurie has rescued over 600 animals including chickens, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, goats. The book is structured chronologically following Laurie's life, but there are short sections at the end of each chapter that tell the story of one of the animals she has rescued. And I loved all the pictures included so I could see each of the animals she wrote about! The story is beautifully told. It's heartbreaking but hopeful. It leads you on an emotional journey. I'd highly recommend this memoir if you love animals (but be prepared for graphic animal abuse), if you enjoy reading about someone following their dreams and if you love emotional reads.\n",

      "Funny Farm tells of Laurie Zaleski's younger years in a beautiful house, with a happy, incredibly stylish mother ... and a violently abusive father. Annie ultimately grabbed her three children and escaped, moving into a shack in the woods. Annie had zero money and the shack was filled with trash, without electricity, heat, or running water. Laurie’s mother took a job at animal control, cleaning the areas where the dogs and cats were kept, and she was able to get the shack set up with running water, electricity, and heat. However, she ended up rescuing so many animals that were about to be euthanized, that she nicknamed their shack the Funny Farm, a name the author would use when she formally opened an animal rescue farm in her mother’s honor. There was one part of Funny Farm that probably would have prevented my reading the book had I known about it in advance. That's when Laurie's abusive father found where the family was staying, poisoned and killed the family's five dogs, and shot and killed their horse. So many parts of Funny Farm were hilarious and I absolutely loved reading the beautiful stories of animals who became, not just rescues, but FAMILY. Ultimately, Funny Farm is a lovely tribute to a woman whose legacy of hard work, and her love of animals continues in her daughter and the farm dedicated to her memory. I just wish it had contained more stories about the rescued animals...\n",

      "“So this is healing, then, the opposite of the ambiguous dread: fullness. I am full of anger, pain, peace, love, of horrible shards and exquisite beauty, and the lifelong challenge will be to balance all of those things, while keeping them in the circle. Healing is never final. It is never perfection. But along with the losses there are triumphs. I accept the lifelong battle and its limitations now. Even though I must always carry the weight of grief on my back, I have become strong.”\n",

      "Going into this, one might wonder, why does this Indian looking guy, sounding guy care about a book, written by the assistant of a semi-retired talk show host, who is, by the viewership at least, not even at the top of the list. That’s because the host is Conan O’Brien, and the assistant is his wing man/ work sibling Sona Movsesian (Sorry Andy). \tNow, like most viewers of my pedigree, I came to know of Conan’s particular brand of entertainment through…YouTube, ding, ding. Even back then, what set him apart from his contemporaries was how earnest and organic entertainer, especially when it comes to off the cuff bits and his engaging interaction with fans and strangers. And let’s face it, no one can work a crowd with little or no prep time like Conan, the guy has just that much charisma. And despite being known as having a somewhat risqué form of comedy early in his career, he ironically has some of the more wholesome and family friendly sketches amongst the increasingly rowdy talk show crowd, catering to a demographic which is getting shallower with shorter attention spans, leaning on the more bizarre and sometimes morbid. But I digress. \tOne aspect that made me a repeat viewer of Conan is the way he could go into any room, street, and even foreign country, and immediately start chatting up strangers. What’s more, he’s able to form human as well as humorous connections with what amounts to complete strangers. This guy is the antithesis of me, whose batteries are drained after a handful of social interactions. He’s a people’s person through and through. \tThis personability translates to his relationship with his colleagues and staff. By now, for those who are in the fandom, or Team Coco as we’re colloquially called, known of the almost reverent tale, of Conan getting sacked at NBC, and paying his whole staff out of his pockets during the intermittent period. He is someone who genuinely cares about the people who work with him. \tNaturally, this has translated to some high morale and great rapport he has with everyone from an unpaid intern to his sidekick/ wingman Andy Richter. Some of Conan’s most popular bits are segments “Conan without borders” where he travels to different cultures and interacts with people on the ground level, which makes for much wholesome and humorous entertainment. Then there are the shorts he shoots with members of his staff, such as Aaron Bleyaert, Jordan Schlansky and of course, assistant Sona Movsesian. In an era where many celebrities and talk show host *cough* Dory *cough* are in hot water for the toxic way they treat their subordinates, Conan is someone who has unwittingly gained more popularity for going the opposite route. His employees might not get Rolexes, Cars, or homes as gifts, but at least they get respect. (Though Sona might disagree). \tSona’s semi autobiography, memoirs, journal whatever might be the technical term for it, tells of how, sometimes, when you’re true to your nature, regardless of how eccentric it might be, sometimes, just sometimes, you might end up in a workplace that lets you slack off, get to watch a 'Friends' marathon at work, and order dinner pretending to your Boss. As well as said Boss, caring very little if you’re actually doing your job, using you as the sounding board or butt of the jokes he’s making, someone who knocks muffins out of your hands, and wrecks your car, buying you a new wrecked one; trust me, it’s better than it sounds. \tReading the book was a breeze, in the sense that most of the pages were illustrations, as well as some sections which are intentionally meandering to make up for the page count. And it’s not misleading, cause the writer specifically says that she’s just dragging it out for the page count. Even if you’re getting scammed, it helps when the scammer is being upfront with you. \tAlso, no offense to Sona, but I’m fairly certain that most people who picked up the book, did so more to know about how Conan is behind the scenes, to know about more anecdotes from a source that is (fairly) unbiased in the matter. To put it another way, I’m reading it more to know about this stepsibling-esque relationship shared by Sona and Conan, cause it’s quite engaging to watch on screen. \tSecondly, while reading through the book, I considered it was ironic that Conan’s assistant managed to publish a book before the man himself. Now, that is certainly not because he lacks the connections or know how to write a book. Despite acting like the arrogant asshole buffoon on screen, O’ Brien is a Harvard graduate, and a lifelong history buff, who was also writer for popular shows such as the Simpsons and SNL. Reading some of his literature outside of his chosen career, can reveal to you a person who’s quite good with his words and engaging to listen to. If some day in the future, we do get a published work in the future, I’m half certain that it’s going to be some historical introspective treatise about the Russian revolution, communism, its rise and fall, or something along the line, perchance with some humorous prose. But until that time, the only thing we have to go is his thoughtful yet hilarious foreword to Sona’s book (which leaves you wanting for more)\tSo, here’s hoping. Oh, the current book, yeah, it’s funny in places, easy to read, typical Sona in how lazy and chippy it is; and all that. Give it a try for a leisurely after meal afternoon perusal. P.S: Next in line, Jordan Schlansky's detailed travelogue about Italy, with special featurette on the TDS quality of its waters.\n",

      "This was a really fun and charming book! I have grown to appreciate Conan O’Brien over the years, and I appreciate him even more now that I know what he has to go through having Sona as an assistant. Kidding aside, it seems like they have a working relationship that serves them both well, and I appreciate that Conan allows Sona to be herself and have a life apart from work when that is in no way the norm. She seems pretty awesome (though a terrible role model (or the best role model?)), and I enjoyed her audiobook performance as well!\n",

      "Listened to the multi-narrator audio version of this book, which is a fantastic way to experience it.Overall, this is a decent YA mystery, but nothing especially groundbreaking or memorable. The premise is interesting--three high school students who were friends when they were younger decide to skip school one day. They end up witnessing the death of another one of their classmates and others think they are possibly involved.It's a little predictable, but the teen characters are endearing and interesting. There are some storylines about drug trafficking and there's a decent twist in the end. If you like YA mysteries, you can't go wrong with Karen McManus, and the audiobook is a great choice.\n",

      "You know how uncomfortable it gets to read a book with references to corona or anything very new or Gen Z? Yeah that should have happened in here but it did not. This plays after the corona virus when another virus breaks out that wipes out most of the population.This is a survivor story between two teenage guys that could not be more different and I think that made this book soooo good. The romance was such a good written subplot that I was rooting for them the entire time but not mad that it took soooo long for smth to happen bc you know #slowburn. Let's not even get me started on the fact that the humour In this book is exactly mine. I find it often horrible to read jokes that I would say but something in here made them very entertaining. I am mostly referring to the fact that this is a post apocalyptic book and that you have still time and energy to joke about the simplest things. It just made this book soo much fun. There was also a number of real life issues that are still (sadly) present to this day and I really liked how they tried to do what is best for them to keep themselves safe\n",

      "\"The melody started slow in the night, a plucking of strings, snowflakes falling dreamily, one flake at a time; and then a burst of cold air poured down on them, and flakes eddied, biting in the chill, the north wind coursing through the living room. Dawn came, light glistening off a frozen pond.\"Ray McMillian painted all this for them through the melody that permeated through the air. His talent streamed within the strings and the light touches of the bow of PopPop's ancient violin. The music carried itself from his very bones and from the hidden chambers of his mind. He was born to play.Brendan Slocumb creates an experience for all of us through The Violin Conspiracy. He broadens his scope to reach out to all who have been dismissed and diminished in society. This novel speaks out against those who view others with a tainted lens that dims the dreams and hopes of far too many based on race, gender, social status, perceived intelligence, and wrongful stereotyping. Ray's story will shine a light upon those darkened corners.Ray's grandmother, Nora, is one of those light bearers. Ray has always shown an interest in the violin and has been relegated to his school violin on loan. But his grandmother gifts him with possession of his great-great-grandfather's violin. Slocomb will take us back on a journey of the origins of this instrument and why it is so precious in the eyes of Ray and his grandmother. It is through the strength of those vibes that Ray becomes better and better. He astounds his teachers even without the enhancement of private lessons.But things at home take on a different slant. His mother is demanding in her nature and she expects Ray to quit school and work at the local Popeye's to bring in money to help raise his twin sisters. She shuts him down at every opportunity and throws his vision of a musical career to the wayside. Ray will remember his grandmother's words and he bends over backwards to compensate his family with odd jobs while keeping focused on his dream. Lack of support from our own is the sharpest arrow to the heart.The Violin Conspiracy will pivot back and forth to the present where Ray's precious violin has been stolen from his hotel room. He's soon to leave to Moscow for the Tchaikovsky Competition. Ray is absolutely distraught. We will come to find that this old violin in the cracked alligator case is worth far more than anyone ever expected. And the race to get the violin back will burn up the following pages.This is Brendan Slocumb's debut novel. He speaks through a voice of painful experiences himself. Just read the Author's Note at the end. It boggles the mind to think of the numbers of humanity who have been shunned and ridiculed and forced from their dreams and their inner talents because of the cruelty of others hellbent on destruction for a myriad of demented reasons. Maybe, just maybe, a little bit of Ray will remain long after the last page.......his resilience and his determination to block the shadows of negativity.....to step around and to step in an unexpected direction that raises us to a far higher level for ourselves and for those who'll follow.\n",

      "I enjoyed reading this book and rate it 4 stars. It is more of a story of the world of classical musicians than a mystery. Ray McMillian is a poor black teenager who dreams of becoming a professional musician. The book has a somewhat improbable premise of a beat up family violin turns out to be an authentic Stradivarius. Ray's violin is stolen and the thief wants $5 million.The mystery of who stole the violin is solved. More enlightening is the reality of the all too real racism present in the classical music world. The author is a professional musician and some of the racist experiences are his. I also enjoyed the descriptions of his music. One quote: \"The melody started slow, in the night, a plucking of strings, snowflakes falling dreamily, one flame at a time; and then a burst of food and poured down on them, and flakes eddied, biting in the chill, the north wine course through the living room.\"Thanks to Knopf Doubleday Publishing and Brendan Slocum for sending me this eARC through NetGalley. #TheViolinConspiracy #NetGalley\n",

      "❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ “And none of that mattered. No matter how nice the suit, no matter how educated his speech or how strong the handshake, no matter how much muscle he packed on, no matter how friendly or how smart he was, none of it mattered at all. He was just a Black person. That’s all they saw and that’s all he was.” While I did find The Violin Conspiracy to be a bit all over the place the author's acknowledgements hit hard. The book opens in medias res with Ray McMillian, our main character, discovering that his Stradivarius has been stolen. Ray is preparing for the international Tchaikovsky Competition and without his fiddle, he feels unmoored. The narrative then jumps back in time where we meet Ray in his teens and learn more about his family situation. His mother wants him to drop school so he can work full time and so she can buy a new tv. When Ray begins to earn good money by playing at various events she quietens down somewhat but she still clearly disapproves of his violin playing and often ridicules him and his belief that he could pursue a career as a violinist. The only supportive member of his family is Ray’s beloved grandmother who loves him to bits. She also wants him to play and gifts him her grandpa’s fiddle. Ray eventually ends up getting a scholarship for a prestigious college. His mother doesn’t want him to go but Ray is determined to follow his path. He eventually learns that his violin is a Stradivarius. His family wants him to sell it and claim that it was never his, to begin with. To keep them at bay Ray begins to send them large sums of money but they never seem satisfied. He also begins to receive thinly threatening letters from a family that claims to be the righteous owners of the violin, and it turns out that they are descendants of the people who had once enslaved Ray’s great-grandfather. Eventually, the narrative reaches the beginning, where Ray’s beloved violin has been stolen and the competition is just around the corner.Throughout the narrative, the author highlights just how racist and elitist the classical music world is. From when he played as a teenager at venues to his time as a teacher and a professional violinist, Ray experiences racism. Classical music is something that is often associated with whiteness and because of this Ray has to fight to be accepted into this world. No matter how hard he proves himself he will be confronted with people dismissing his skills, claiming that he is a ‘diversity token’ or diminishing his talent. There are many harrowing scenes where Ray is mistreated and abused, and the realism of these scenes made it clear that these episodes had likely been experienced by the author himself (such as the wedding one early on). From outright racist remarks to more ‘veiled’ ones, Ray has to fight tooth and nail to claim a space in this extremely white elitist world. That he has no support from his family certainly doesn’t help as with the exception of his grandmother and an aunt, they are all keen on him selling his violin. The novel tries to combine a Bildungsroman novel with a more suspenseful storyline but the two don't quite mesh together. The flashbacks into Ray’s teenage years do add context to his life and the violin but they fail to make him into a more rounded character. I found him rather flat, at times a little more than a vehicle to move the story forward. I would have liked for him to have a more defined personality and a more developed characterisation. Other characters were similarly one-dimensional, Ray’s mother in particular. She’s portrayed as a horrible person: every scene she is in she says something awful. She has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and I could not understand why Ray would bother with her at all. He also has siblings but we never see him interact with them. His other relatives, with the exception of that one aunt, are all greedy and nasty to him. The bad characters in this book are also extremely one-note. This is fair enough, a simplistic approach could have worked but I found it annoying that the author would describe these characters as physically ‘ugly’ and are often ‘fat’. The woman who claims that the violin belongs to her family for instance has ‘jowls’ covered by ‘downy hair’. All of the policemen are of the doughnut-eating variety, but this, I didn’t mind as much given my less than warm feelings towards them. Anyway, the story suggests that either Ray’s family or this white family are behind his missing violin. The novel then takes a weird turn by making someone else responsible and forgetting almost entirely of Ray’s family or that other one. It just seemed an odd choice and a predictable one at that. I also did not care for the way Ray spoke about or describes women (“the tawny-haired woman with the tight dress running her fingers suggestively around her wineglass”; “The attractive women who seemed to take an interest in him were mostly in the look-but-don’t-touch category”; “A young athletic woman was crossing in front of them, her toned ass bouncing with every step in her black leggings.”). The writing too could be quite cheesy, especially in its efforts to tie everything back to classical music (“He tried to breathe but his ribs had been wrapped in piano wire”; “Why was he so terrible at talking to this woman? She was violin-shaped, right? So why was this so hard?”). Still, while I wasn’t a huge fan of the writing or the characters, the story was relatively engaging. If you are interested in this novel I recommend that you check it out yourself.\n",

      "I listened to the audio of “The Devil Takes You Home” by Gabino Iglesias narrated perfectly by Jean-Marc Berne. This dark noir story is an internal narration, something like a meditation of sorts, of a desperate man, tormented by bad fortune resulting in very bad decisions.Mario just lost his precious daughter to cancer. He and his wife racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital debt in an attempt to save their daughter. She died anyway. Mario’s wife left him, and Mario receives daily texts reminding him how much money he owes to the hospital. He is desperate.A friend of his, Brian, who is a junky with a pregnant girlfriend, suggests that they get involved with the Mexican cartel for some quick and serious cash. When Brian introduces Mario to the head of the cartel, after Mario exchanges his pleasantries, the cartel man says:“I was just telling your friend Mario that meeting me is never a pleasure; meeting me is something that happens to people because they have made a bad decision.”This story is one bad decision after another. This reminded me of the Netflix series “Ozark” in that it shows how a man, trying to take care of his family, gets sucked into the harsh and disturbing world of the Cartels. Iglesias is heavy handed with religious supernatural encounters, most of them revolting and horrific. He shows how tightly religion is tied into the Cartel life. I was happy that I chose the audio because it’s written in Spanish and English. I got to hear the Spanish spoken, which made the story more realistic in my mind. Spanglish is used frequently which wasn’t a distraction to me as I listened. I’m not a Spanish speaker, yet I enjoyed this remarkable devise he used. Bilingual readers will love it. As with “Ozark” this is a horror-thriller. I usually stay away from such darkness, but for some reason, I found this captivating, much like watching “Ozark”. Bad news: you can’t close your eyes when it’s your imagination from reading.I really need to find a box of puppies now…..\n",

      "\"Being in the presence of monsters is okay as long as you don’t think too much about what they’re capable of. The scarier thing is what you’re capable of yourself.\"Similarly to S.A Cosby’s Razorblade Tears and Stephen Graham Jones’ The Only Good Indians, this book is violence and retribution, grief and pain. This is a book you’ll be gripping tightly as you read, a book with human monsters and paranormal underworlds, a book that will leave your jaw on the floor as it did mine. Having read and loved author Gabino Iglesias’ short story contribution to one of my favorite anthologies--Orphans of Bliss, this is not my first introduction to his writing. But it is my first deep dive into a full novel and Iglesias' prose are as beautiful as they are raw, gritty, self-aware, and emotional. The story follows Mario, a struggling father and husband who is suddenly delivered a ghastly blow when he learns his 4 year old daughter has been diagnosed with leukemia. In a desperate hope of securing cash to pay debts, he consults a friend who offers him a very dangerous job. Mario will soon see how much of a monster he is willing to become for love and family. As readers follow Mario on this blood-soaked journey, themes of systemic oppression, racism, poverty, religion, traditions, and family are laid out effortlessly. And the ending!!!! You will be emotionally gutted by the final page. Thank you to Mulholland Books for my advanced review copy of this brilliant book.\n",

      "The most recent Dan Chaon (“Shawn”) novel, to be released mid-April, did not disappoint. Not as complex nor as fragmented as You Remind Me of Me, Sleepwalk moves like a film. I kept imagining Jesse Plemons as the laid-back and likable mercenary, and singular guide of this surprisingly emotional, speculative-fiction adventure. And this film-like feeling may have been deliberate, as the main character often disassociates and begins narrating as he watches his own life unfold. The story begins by bringing us into the main character, Billy’s, work routine, which is clearly on the fringe of society. Turns out Bill lives completely off the grid! Or so he thought - until someone, somehow has tracked him down. And this someone has an odd story to tell, which just gets odder as we and William struggle to fill in the picture.This novel has a different kind of puzzle-building feel from You Remind Me of Me, but it does have one. And as we learn the details of this world they feel half off-kilter and half familiar. There’s an eerie quality to what our protagonist is up against, both in what he expects (like a particular kind of traffic jam), and what he doesn’t expect (the main story), because the world he inhabits - one where morals become relative - feels too close for comfort. Sleepwalk could only take place in this context, and everything in this story dances on that boundary between marginal and familiar. The protagonist, Will, is told that a small choice from his past has snowballed into something huge, in part because he didn’t have all the facts about his own life. As he learns, he sees all the people and events from his past through a new lens. The story makes us question what we trust and what we don’t, while once again playing with the yearning for connection, specifically family connection. That yearning to understand ourselves through connection with family seems to be at the heart of both Chaon novels I’ve read.Dan Chaon is a new-to-me favorite author, and I feel lucky to have won the Goodreads giveaway from Henry Holt Books.\n",

      "Dan Chaon honed his catchy thriller-esque atmosphere into a tense road novel reminiscent of Philip K. Dick's off-kilter weirdness and soft-dystopian Straw Dogs-style manhunts. An addictive read with dark undertones establishing the prescient consequences of social media, drugs, cloning, the morals of biological and artificial relations and other deep and relevant stuff. Yet, the close first person perspective focuses the lens on a flawed hero, whose descent into the Inferno is appropriately brutal. Somehow manages to come off as heartfelt amid the bleak and blasted remains of a landscape fertilized by American corpses.\n",

      "Full disclosure: I won a free ARC of this book in a Goodreads giveaway. Bill Bear has had so many aliases over the years, that he thinks of himself as The Barely Blur. He makes a living by staying under the radar and doing odd jobs: assassinations, cleanup work, retrievals, deliveries. His life runs smoothly, until he finds out about the daughter he never even knew he had …Sleepwalk is a novel of the near future. Although the year isn't specified (at least, not that I recall), it's clearly not far from our present era. It's just one or two plagues past COVID, one or two wars past Ukraine, one or two frontpage natural disasters past … you get the idea. We follow the Blur through an America very much like our own as he learns about his own past and possible future. Both characters and settings ring true, and the novel moves at a brisk pace. I was in suspense right up through the end, wondering how it was all going to turn out. This was my first Dan Chaon book. I now understand why so many people are talking about him. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Samuel Adams was so entwined in the events leading up to the American Revolution, that reading his biography is like reading an historical account of those events. Author Stacy Schiff ably brings this history to life in this fascinating volume that richly details the life of the man many believe was the linchpin to the Revolution. Never dull, The Revolutionary Samuel Adams is a well documented and scholarly read, one that is never boring. The sections that deal with the Boston Tea Party and Lexington and Concord (that latter episode opens the book) are very detailed and interesting. Kudos to the author for bringing the man to life.My thanks to the publisher and to Netgalley for providing an ARC of this book.\n",

      "I thought I had a decent grasp of the subject matter, turns out I did not ... We were all raised to believe that the Revolution happened because the mother country mistreated its citizens, that is, taxation without representation, et al ... this book (essentially covering Adams life from around 1760 to 1775) says that some of that happened but, mostly, it was the constant agitation of one Samuel Adams, a relentless, prolific propaganda generator; without him, the Revolution doesn't happen ... fascinating ... the author makes the short book a long read through a painful writing style and sentences that are hard to understand\n",

      "I will have to confess that I didn't expect to like this book, but Gina Chen nailed the delivery she promised, and I couldn't be more surprised at how I adored it. Violet Made of Thorns is an enchanting book with a refreshing take on the sub-genre of dark fairytales that mildly reminds me of The Cruel Prince.VMOT has every trope you could dream of: strong Asian female protagonist, REAL enemies-to-lovers with delightful banter, royal setting, prophecies, and betrayals. The way the author put everything together results in a compelling story with strong twists and turns, and an incredible dynamic between the characters, both platonic and romantic. I would do anything for Violet and Cyrus, and I would sell a kidney to kiss Camilla. That's how much I love the characters.After Goodreads, this is supposed to be a duology, and honestly, I know all too well the pain of waiting for the sequel of a book that is not yet released. My grabby hands need the sequel, like, yesterday. 4.5/5 - a surprising coup de coeur.Many thanks to Delacorte Press and Netgalley for this advanced copy. This review contains my opinion only.\n",

      "— 3.5 blog | instagram | twitter | pinterest this was easily one of my more anticipated releases of 2022, and it wasn’t just because of the absolutely stunning cover. violet made of thorns is a dark fantasy that follows violet, resident seer and witch of the sun capital. reading in her pov will make you feel one of two things: you’ll either love to hate her or hate to love her. she’s super witty and so much fun to read about. she’s also very confident and unapologetic for her words and actions which I really loved, and it really added to her character. personally, I love reading books where the protagonist is also an antagonist in the eyes of their peers. in this book, violet is the antiheroine that everyone will be rooting for.“perfect for fans of the cruel prince and serpent & dove”. okay i see where they were going with this but i’m going to have to disagree with the first part. the romance is definitely angsty and filled with sexual tension but I’m not going to lie, this didn’t really match up to the level i was hope it would. but I loved reading the banter between cyrus and violet and how it kept escalating throughout the book. they played the ‘enemies’ part in enemies to lovers pretty well. I wasn’t entirely sold on the ‘lovers’ part though, if I’m being honest. I felt that it was a little rushed towards the end, especially in the last few chapters. but there’s a lot of backstabbing and betrayals that make up for it. you don’t really see that in many enemies to lovers books these days.its evident how the book draws on a lot of fairytale influences throughout the story. i would have loved to see a little more world building though because the details we got just felt too limited. a broader view of what was going on would’ve probably changed a lot for me. I do also think that it just overall felt a little too rushed towards the end. there were a lot of things that did not make sense, leaving me more confused than jaw dropped. however, im hoping book 2 clarifies a lot of the questions I have. I can’t wait to read more about violet and her potential character growth in the sequel.even though violet made of thorns didn’t have the wow factor I was personally looking for, I do think a lot of the elements at play made it a fairly interesting and unique read so i’d recommend checking it out at the very least.» thank you to delacorte press and netgalley for the arc !! -----------5/12/2021 | ENEMIES TO LOVERS EXCELLENCE !! I really enjoyed reading this one and violet was a really interesting protagonist. full rtc closer to the release date !!---------“fairytale romance for people who would consider literal murder before considering they might have feelings”yes I’m a sucker for dark fantasies with pretty covers what about it\n",

      "the YA fantasy genre is declining in quality. the romance is pitched as \"i can fix her\" meets \"i can make him worse\" and what's not to love abt that? and our main character is an antihero too! so i was supposed to love this book bc doesn't that sound fun at all? i'm always up for fun! i'm an enjoyer of fun things! i was supposed to be very obsessed with the couple. yet i was sorely disappointed with the quality. like is this what the YA fantasy genre is producing..? truly? final answer??? like why was the storytelling so poor..... and why was the worldbuilding so lousy. why was the writing so lackluster and inconsistent. where was the impact? i read the words and i felt nothing. i read lines that i know the author thought were bangers, because i could just tell that the author was itching to write them down, but they did not give what was supposed to be given. she was supposed to eat, but she choked and regurgitated instead :/ i felt nothing while reading. but hey, it's not completely terrible! perhaps the only thing i liked abt this is Violet's characterization. she's a liar and she's cynical and she's also a bit mean-spirited. i like her because she doesn't try to be nice at all. but that's all i liked abt the book. the romance was dry, there's not much to say. the promised hate-kissing did not serve. the rest is abysmal. let me explain a bit: i said the worldbuilding was lousy, bc we have dragons, fairies (in tinker bell size), fates, and PISTOLS. yes, pistols! thing is, you can't just mention pistols and then leave it at that. where do they even get the gunpowder? see, i have no fucking idea what the world even looks like here. i have no clear picture of the setting, even the castle descriptions are paltry. i know we have a bridge, some halls, the tower (where our main character lives), the gardens, and..? we just have to fill in the rest apparently. anyway, this is one of my most anticipated YA releases and i am so disappointed lmao if this is what the genre is producing nowadays, i do not think i will read any more YA fantasy. i'll need to find an alternative genre to read for fun. bc YA fantasy should at least be fun and entertaining even if the rest is bad, but this one is just laughable.i received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n",

      "This novel was better than I had hoped. I got it free on Amazon and gave it a try. I’ve read a couple WWII historical fiction, but this was my first Asian one. The writing was eloquent and at times you could feel the smells and environment around you. My only downside is that it is a romance through and through- which just isn’t my style. The cultural insights were nice. I’d call this “Joy Luck Club” meets every WWII historical fiction you ever read. I liked it though- gotta admit there were some times I didn’t want to put it down, mostly because the characters were well developed and I was invested in them. Worth the read.\n",

      "Note: I was provided an ARC of this novel at the North Texas Teen Book Festival.“The Marvellers” is a book with a number of strengths: it brings us fascinating, creative magical systems, a world full of life and history that feels like a natural fit for said magic system, and characters who are engaging to read about.Unfortunately, it is also a novel with a number of weaknesses.Let’s start with the most prevalent: the worldbuilding. Now, once the story gets going, it is incredibly easy to become lost in the magic of this world, an alternate Earth with just enough similarities to our own to seem somewhat familiar. But it is unfortunately one that is very complicated, with not just one but two magic systems: Conjuring and Marvelling.Marvelling, at least, is described in some detail, which makes sense given the nature of the story (I mean, the title is literally “The Marvellers”, after all). But even so, there are still many questions left by the end of this book that feel like they should have been answered: what does it mean if someone steals someone else’s Marvel? How does having two Marvels even work?Conjuring is described with even less detail, which is unfortunate since the main character, Ella Durand, is herself a Conjurer from a long line of them. Why exactly Marvellers stand at the top of society why Conjurers are looked down upon is unclear, as is the difference between the two magic systems.In addition to how complicated the magic systems are, the rest of the worldbuilding results in what can best be described as a sluggish pace. The plot often takes a backseat as Clayton goes on to describe fine details of her world, such as food or creatures that end up having no real bearing on the story, and it results in a pacing that is uneven and awkward. When the plot does get going, boy howdy does it get going. But there are so many long pauses and breaks in between that it is easy to forget what exactly we’re supposed to be caring about.Some of this, I feel, is due to the very forced nature of the plot’s timing: like many magic-school books, this story is set over the course of Ella’s first year at Arcanum Training Institute. Yet important parts of the plot don’t mesh with the slower nature of this kind of story: a prisoner breaks out of the Underworld (which it’s never really explained how that exists in this world), and then it takes…2-3 months for them to do anything? The heroes find out that their beloved teacher is missing in January, but don’t really do anything about it until May. A student accuses Ella of harming her in December but doesn’t bother to report it until May. Much of the story feels like it is standing in place – the characters don’t necessarily grow much during these intervening months, and yet the time has passed regardless.In the end, “The Marvellers” is a book with a lot of promise, certainly with the ambition of setting up a stellar series, but it falls somewhat flat when it is crippled by awkward pacing, maybe-too-detailed worldbuilding, and the very nature of its own type of narrative.Rating: 7.5/10\n",

      "I find myself somewhat torn about Kate Atkinson's new novel, \"Shrines of Gaiety\".I mean, it wasn't bad or awful. Not at all. Her love for the language is apparent as ever and as always. Her vocabulary and writing style is simply magical. She's a true artist and its shown clearly in this new offering, like a painter having fun with the colors on the canvas. Her imagination and description are as vivid as ever, and 1926 London felt alive, vivid, lifeful, as if you can just go and visit there. Foe me, it's one of the main reasons why I always come back to her novels- her love of language, vocabulary and imagination are boundless. Unfortunately, there's a but.. \"Shrines of Gaiety\" biggest problem is its characters. They're.. dull, would you believe? Most of them seem irrelevant to the story (I'm looking at you, Florence. Seriously, what was her purpose? It seemed like she was just there for the sake of being included in the story, but her impact on the story in nonexistent), and are not relatable. Freda and Gwendolen are the only characters who manage to elicit some emotion from the reader, while all the others seem superficial and lifeless. The plot also is a slow-burner, which on the one hand is quite understandable, as you have a huge cast of characters to contend with, so it takes time for the story to get going. It gets somewhat interesting as the you move along, with some great instances of humor and even some suspense, but for the most part, it's just boring and gets too long to get the point. Also, it was hard to even hate Maddox or Azzopardi, as they both aren't developed enough are just bland \"Bad Guys\". The ending itself is quite weird. Seemed rushed in some parts, and somewhat confusing (Gwendolen and Niven's part, and particularly Florence's part. It just seemed so out of place, odd and pointless). 3 and a half stars, rounded down to three. \"Shrines of Gaiety\" definitely has all the usual hallmarks of a Kate Atkinson novel, and as mentioned above, her writing style, vocabulary, imagination and attention to detail is superb as usual. But the plot itself is too slow to develop, and the characters themselves are bland and non-engaging and underdeveloped, and these factors definitely hurt the novel. Although, if you do fancy a visit to 1926 London, this novel definitely takes you there with its vivid, lifelul descriptions. All in all, not a bad novel to pass the time with, but definitely not one of Atkinson's best works.\n",

      "4+  \"Crime pays. Fighting it doesn't.\"London, 1926, a city of contrasts: dirty, crime-ridden, struggling to shake itself back to life, to normalcy. And the people, feeling a new freedom denied them for so long. Horrific memories of the war are best swept away, and what better way to do so than visiting a nightclub, a whole string of them to choose from. Nellie Coker, the matriarch of a not so law-abiding nightclub empire, wants you to enjoy yourself, add to her wealth. Inspired by the real life Kate Mayfield, Nellie is a self-made, self-serving, ruthless, and savvy businesswoman. Like empires throughout history, this one is in danger of crumbling, and there are many who would like to see its demise. None more so than John Frobisher, chief inspector of London’s police department. His most unlikely accomplice is Gwendolen Kelling, a former librarian who has come to the city searching for two missing girls from her hometown. Gwendolen would also like to add some spice to her dull existence. She is in the right place at the right time to get just that.This novel is a fast-paced story of intrigue mixed with history. The spunky Ms. Kelling reminded me of Juliet Armstrong in Atkinson’s novel, Transcription. Witty and interesting characters are a trademark of this author’s writing and Shrines of Gaiety is no exception. Clever women, often deliciously nefarious, are peppered throughout. Nellie is the female version of John Boyne’s Maurice Swift. I enjoyed this novel immensely, although I had really hoped for a novel more like Life After Life and God in Ruins. Perhaps I won’t have to wait too long . Meanwhile, anything by this great writer will be worthwhile.\n",

      "An entertaining historical novel set in 1920’s London. There are lots of vivid characters and the story jumps from one to the other a lot. It took a while for the story to come together and often I was confused about the timelines (especially Freda and Florence). It mostly centres around a character called Nellie Coker who is just released from jail at the start of the novel. Based on a real person she runs a collection of nightclubs and her children are involved in running them. There’s police corruption, prostitution and drugs, murder and missing girls all of which should’ve made this novel much darker and I probably would’ve preferred it if it had been (more like Peaky Blinders maybe?) but the tone is light throughout and there’s a lot of references to The Green Hat, a novel I had never heard of before, making me wonder if I should have!\n",

      "This book may look daunting at 656 pages, but it was a quick read. I do wish the book had stuck with a single perspective a little longer at times, but I also did enjoy the variety of characters whose perspectives we get to see. The world building is very interesting and while I am left with questions I don’t think that’s by accident in the first book of a pretty epic trilogy (if the first book’s girth implies anything). I think these characters and the story are the kind that will stick with me which is good because I’ll need to know what happened when the second book comes out. In this book some children, mostly orphans, are Talents, have odd skills that keep them from finding family or being accepted in society. And there is a hidden school, but it’s goals and secrets seem darker than similar series.\n",

      "What a great book! Set in the London of Jack the Ripper, Ordinary Monsters is one part Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and one part Showtime's Penny Dreadful series. I loved it!Some children are born with rare and unusual talents. Charlie Ovid is a teenager who has been executed three times for committing murder. Charlie won't stay dead and in fact, he hides his most prized possessions by burying them inside his body. Cutting things back out is painful, but it's worth it to keep his mother's ring safe. Marlow is 8, small for his age and glows blue. The book opens with his kidnapping as an infant to save him from a menacing figure. He's found in a train car and comes to be raised in a travelling circus by a strongwoman who has a powerful maternal instinct.The start of the book - admittedly the slowest part - is focused on the boys' backstories and how they are eventually approached by Alice Quick and Frank Colton. These detectives explain that they track down children with \"talents\" and bring them back to the Cairndale Institute in Scotland, where they will be with other unusual children like themselves. Once Charlie and Marlow are brought together, the pace picks up and the development of their brotherly friendship goes to the big heart of this book.Starting at this point, something actiony is always going on until the very last page. For me, the highlight was an incredible train chase involving the boys, the detectives, Marlow's guardian Britt, and two Big Bads that are creepy and compelling: Jacob Marber, a former talented child himself who has turned evil, and Walter, a childhood friend of Jacob's whom he's turned into a lich. J.M. Miro did a great job creating dread as we watch Jacob and Walter make their way through the train cars, searching for the children while the adults make heroic efforts to stop them.One of my reading updates predicted Ordinary Monsters will make it as one of the biggest YA Fantasies of the year, and I stick by that. It will definitely make GR's Choice Awards, but the competition will be steep against Maas' House of Sky and Breath. It'll even be a tough call for me, but we'll see! Highly, highly recommended.\n",

      "You're likely to know Mr. Rickman through his work in the Harry Potter films, Die Hard or Love, Actually. I found him through a smaller, throwaway role in a movie called The January Man. Then, of course, as Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility. I imagine he would prefer to be remembered for his theatre work, though the majority of that took place in London and far from the world's maddening crowds. He did not construct this book; these are entries from his private journals spanning the years 1993 to 2015, the time of his passing. His notes are brief and bulleted, barely expressing a thought, and those couched among a litany of famous names with whom he had a drink, or dinner, or worked. He rarely opines on these characters, merely listing the people and how the time was spent - so you may think, and be forgiven for doing so, what's the bloody point of all of this?And that's where things get interesting.Madly, Deeply is a subtle piece of business and requires more dedication than one is used to expending on content from a posthumous diary. Forty pages in and you're not there yet; not in the state of mind that will make this material matter. His brevity encourages speed, you see; encourages sailing through for a film or a reference; a little dish, an anecdote, an insider's remark, and there's not enough of that to maintain such a pace. You will stall. Count on it. And if, at these moments, you were to pause, to still, to listen very hard, you might actually hear that low-throated voice say, in its trademark cutting tone, \"Yes, well, it might be of help if you could manage to pay attention.\"There is depth here. A personality emerges, a nature unfolding. Startling in its shift from pragmatism to wistfulness and yearning, then straight back again. But the startling is good, and I'm going to suggest you run with it and resist a preview of the center photographs until you're a few years in. It matters, because it will astonish you in such a wonderful way. More of him comes into view when you see what those journals were and from where this material was taken.Then, naturally, he writes this:...I can only hope that when I look again at the '90s (journal) volumes that I can remember the coded details and the sharp thoughts hidden between the safer lines.Now you will look for them. And a few of them will be found. And there he is.This was a moving experience for me. Also sad at the end because he wrote next to nothing about the disease that took him; the entries simply grew shorter, terser - not so much an aid to memory as an attempt to etch things in. It is obvious Mr. Rickman's journals were meant to act as reference for a potential memoir; a memoir life did not permit him time to compose. And now he's gone, and grief descends.\n",

      "tl;dr: A long, rambling book about the effect (real and perceived) of trauma on the body with some really good points, and some really terrible points. Talk about a polarizing book, woo. This was a long, and exhausting journey to get through. There are some really valuable points in this book, but, unfortunately, it is a scattered mess that also takes it to extremes. The bad thing about taking it to extremes is you then throw away all the valid points made in the book, because people's brains just shut off and say 'well, the whole thing must be bad' when that isn't the case. The pros: - I do agree heavily with the concept that too many medical professionals divide 'brain' and 'body' treatment, as if they are two different things, when it's all connected. - Trauma absolutely affects your body and your immune system. - He talks quite a bit about social inequities and their effects on marginalized people. For example: The maternal mortality rate for Black women being so much higher than for white women. This is something that needs to be a conversation in our society. I love that he brings it up, but unfortunately, he never provides any suggestions for this huge social issue. - He talks about the importance of protecting children and preventing trauma, and how children so often get the proverbial short end of the stick. Another conversation we need to be having. So much of the way society views and treats children does cause harm and prevents them from growing into the healthy adults we want them to be. - He has extensive experience working with people dealing with addiction, and how the root of addiction is people who are suffering and in need. That is so true, and that's something else our society needs to continue to improve on, is not seeing addictions as a fault, but as an unmet need. The cons: - Lots of extremes. So, basically he says even IN UTERO \"trauma\", like a 'stressed mother' can cause 'diseases' like ADHD (which is not a disease). So, while yes, I do think pregnant people need support, and families need support, there is a lot said in here that feels like parent blaming (even though he claims he's not trying to do that). There is a LOT of stuff like \"CIO causes lifelong trauma\" (I never did CIO, but I find that a problematic statement), \"parents being stressed out while a child is young causes lifelong trauma\", etc. And, yes, elements of this are true. I know first hand that a very unstable family life is traumatic. Many of us know about ACE scores and c-ptsd, which are valid traumas and should be discussed, and supported. But, humans are going to get stressed. That's part of being human. His statements become extreme reaches, and it ruins the rest of it.- The book is just a jumbled mess. It's funny, as apparently the author is ADHD and even wrote an older book about 'curing' ADHD, but it makes me laugh, because this book is one long, random tangent that just radiates the ADHD brain process. Perhaps because I am ADHD, I could kind of keep up, but it was exhausting. It felt like there was no editor. It just jumped all over the place. - Some of his 'suggestions' or 'examples' of people who 'healed their trauma' are more extremes like someone who went mountain climbing with former members of the IRA, or someone 'forgiving' their abusers, and that magically 'healed' and erased their trauma somehow. Then, he does a whole chapter focused on the concept of healing via psilocybin experiences (specifically referring to stuff used by peoples in South America, etc). The thing is, again, I've actually READ research about microdosing with psilocybin, and seen research saying it can have a positive effect on traumatized brains. But, instead of using studies that actually hint of scientific proof, he instead tells a story about being in South America with 'shamans' and the ilk. Again, taking it to an extreme that is completely relatable to the majority of people, instead of sticking to the middle ground and using studies around microdosing of certain substances. - He says some really inappropriate and disturbing things about celebrities/political people that he's never met. He does SAY that he hasn't worked with them directly, but I still found his rambles about Trump, Hillary Clinton and especially Robin Williams, to be both pointless and even dangerous. He basically suggests had Robin Williams 'healed his inner trauma' he could still be alive today. It really, really left a bad taste in my mouth. - He also dedicates a substantial amount of space to 'spontaneous healing' with examples of people who had terminal cancer, who did some yoga (paraphrasing) and magically found themselves cured. Again, I DO think that any healing should be multifaceted, but it just smacks of 'woo' and dangerous pseudoscience. There are too many extremes for it to be taken seriously. - Ironically, in his chapter about the inequality of stress and demands placed on women, he closes the chapter by talking about the BENEFITS TO MEN if we can reduce the stress on women. It was just ironic (and eye rolling). ___________________All in all, had this book had some serious editing, it could have been great. But, it's mostly a jumble of stuff, and I find his attitude toward ADHD to be incredibly problematic. He constantly refers to ADHD as a 'disease' or similar terms, and suggesting that trauma causes ADHD. For me, there is a lack of conversation around correlation vs. causation. He ALMOST gets it at one point, with the quote \"Children, especially highly sensitive children, can be wounded in multiple ways\". So, for me, from the neurodiversity standpoint, I see neurodivergent people as more PRONE to trauma and more prone to illness, especially after living through trauma. He definitely seems to have a clear dividing line between ADHD and Autism, even though current research does NOT SUPPORT THAT. Research is showing more and more that ADHD and Autism (as well as other flavors of neurodivergent brains) are genetically connected. As far as mentioning Autism in the book, there are really only two mentions. One was mentioning a 'professional' who brings up two primary stereotypes of Autistic people 'having speech delays and lacking eye contact' and the other is talking very briefly about Greta Thunberg. He seems to cherry pick his 'data' to agree with his own, very biased, point of view. I think the author seems like an interesting person. He has some cool stories to tell. But, this book is heavily biased to the point of being problematic, and is framed up as scientific while using questionable resources to back up his claims. I think we DO need a shift in our medical model, and a better understanding of the brain/body connection, but I also believe some people are simply born disabled, or prone to highly sensitive brains and bodies, and that's regardless of trauma. If you choose to read this, please read it with a heavy dose of salt and good luck.\n",

And that ending  collision  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~When I turned the final page, I sat and tried to absorb the feelings and emotions from this impactful and powerful story. Harris has taken a story that needed to be told and ripped my heart to shreds.Fair warning – you need to be open and willing to read about the aftermath of a sexual assault. Trust me when I say, I was nervous too, but this author takes a tragedy and creates a miracle. It is truly a stunning story.Harris has taken the raw and gritty and gifted us with heart, compassion, healing, forgiveness, and love. Set aside a quiet weekend and read this with tissues and an open mind. One Summer in Savannah and Harris is amazing and brilliant! Brave and compelling! And that ending is nothing short of bomb-tastic!This is the best read of 2023 so far! Harris has just put her name in lights!* copy received for review consideration* full review - https://amidlifewife.com/one-summer-i...'"
