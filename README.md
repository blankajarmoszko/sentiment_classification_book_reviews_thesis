### Goodreads Book Review Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code and the final write-up for a thesis investigating sentiment classification in Goodreads book reviews using machine learning techniques.

#### Abstract

This thesis delves into sentiment classification in Goodreads book reviews through machine learning. It examines the influence of preprocessing methods such as TF-IDF and Bag of Words on classification accuracy, evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Recurrent Neural Networks), and addresses challenges unique to book review texts. The study reveals that TF-IDF consistently outperforms Bag of Words, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy, precision, and recall rates at 65%. Despite these promising results, the complexity of book review texts underscores the necessity for alternative sentiment classification approaches. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of sentiment analysis in literature and suggests avenues for future exploration.
