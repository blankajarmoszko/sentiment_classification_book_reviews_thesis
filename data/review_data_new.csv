The Stolen Heir,Emily May,"2,031",310k,4,"Not quite The Cruel Prince but I enjoyed this a lot.I loved being back in this world. I loved the writing, the familial angst/trauma, the riddles and twists and turns (though I guessed some). I enjoyed Wren as a narrator, though not as much as Jude, but I doubt I will ever come to see Oak as sexy. He's stuck as a little boy in my mind. Also-- hairy feet and hooves? Not my jam 😂Also, the ending was exciting. I await the sequel.","1,206",3
The Stolen Heir,jessica,"2,563",42.2k,4,"hmm. i didnt obsess over this one like i did with the original trilogy.while i did enjoy the characters and the writing, i actually was a little bored of the storyline at times. HOWEVER, the plot takes a VERY compelling turn towards the end that has me highly interested in how the story/series will progress. so i guess thats something!overall, i do think this is a good expansion to the world of elfhame. so heres hoping the story is a little more exciting in the next installment (especially since its going to be a duology).↠ 3.5 stars",654,0

Dear Holly Black, I'm sorry for being selfish and devouring in a matter of hours the book it took you months of hard work to write, but I swear it wasn't my fault.Every time I put it down, it kept calling my name.Picture me currently howling at the moon, crying my eyeballs out and also throwing up a bit.All at the same time.IT. WAS. JUST. THAT. GOOD.One advice I feel like I'm allowed to give you guys is this: don't go into this thinking it's TCP or that Oak/Wren are Jude and Cardan 2.0, because you'd only be preparing yourself for disappointment and it might spoil your enjoyment of the novel.Just read it as its own story and buckle up. This is only the beginning.Holly Black writes the best and cruelest fairytales and even if I've apparently finally outgrown YA books, I'll never stop loving this world she's created.It's much more than what the book genre it's defined by.This entire saga transcends literature barriers and age limits.It's a tale for the past and for the future, and overall a present of the best kind.

I didn't miss them as much as I thought I would.Oak and Wren's journey is action-packed and filled with betrayals, pain and a bittersweet blooming alliance.I love that, while the writing style remained the same (as I've mentioned before, you totally feel like you're back in Elfhame), Wren's voice is perfectly distinguishable from Jude's.And Oak might be in contention with his brother-in-law for the role of Elfhame most handsome flirt.I enjoyed both Oak and Wren's adventures and their characterization, and while I didn't mind the tiny hint of romance we got here and there, I didn't care that it wasn't heart-wrenching in a typical jurdan style - that it was very subtle and innocent, and I surprisingly didn't care that there was very little of it.That's Holly Black for you. She could write about dogs farting Beethoven songs and I'd sit and appreciate the art.I admit, there were times I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the names and terms (some of which I shamelessly forgot about), but it was amazing to be back in this world and it was an honor to be gifted with yet another masterpiece.The Stolen Heir was ironically lighter than Cruel Prince in terms of plot, and at the same time, just as dark in the brutality of what the Folk consider legitimate.There was a certain scene in particular, toward the end, that made my skin crawl, and just Wren's story in general made me reconsider and appreciate the strength of her character even more.Overall, it's YA with a twist. And what a twist that is.THAT ENDING?!?Anyway, this was worth the bloodshot tired eyes; I think I'll add more to this review in the future but for now, this is it.And now, as promised, have some quotes!""Do we have something to hide?"" I ask.He smiles wider, giving me a tug toward the revelers. ""Always.""
""I have a bad habit,"" he saysm ""Of falling in love. With great regularity and to spectacular effect. You see, it never goes well.""
""Come!"" calls a shopkeepe. ""We have the finest jackets in a hundred leagues. Green as poison. Red as blood. Black as the heart of the King of Elfhame.""
He gives me a steady look. ""I hope you're not about to tell me that you hate it and you were just being polite.""""I don't hate it,"" I say softly. ""And I'm not polite.""He laughs at that. ""A delightful qualit.""
""They say that sister of yours has trapped the King in some bargain. Why else marry her? Why else do whatever she wants?""""She's going to want to wear your skull for a hat. And Cardan is going to laugh and laugh as she does.""

i loved this, it was perfect /for me/, but i still enjoyed the cruel prince a lot more (and jude + cardan a lot more). i also feel like some readers might not love that this is a quest storyline so they are constantly traveling throughout this, but that is also something i really enjoy in stories - so i feel extra biased. holly was really giving the creepy and dark fae side with this one and now i am forever screaming at the last scene.... well, until i get book two! trigger + content warnings: kidnapping, parental abuse, physical abuse, torture, abandonment, gore, violence, drugging, vomiting, captivity, murder, blood depictions, self harm to get blood for magic, mention of animal death, suicide mention in past, mention of death in childbirth, ptsd depictions, and a few scenes with bugs/insects/spiders.

The Stolen Heir,Avery (Taylor's version),235,728,3,"“Another girl might have frozen, but I am cold all the way through.”
I already know that this is going to be my most disappointing book of the year. If you know me or have at least seen some of my pre-book updates, you know how obsessive I was over this book, and I was freaking out over every single little detail. I LITERALLY CRIED WHEN I DIDN'T GET THE BOOK IN THE MAIL WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO (to be fair, I wasn't in the best place before that and not getting the book just made it even worse).and now I feel like a fool.What may have also impacted my reading experience was that I wasn't going through the best time while reading this, my mental health I guess you could say, wasn't doing good and that greatly affected my experience, pushing me into a reading/mental slump. I'd put it off for a bit and read a few comfort reads, which did help me. I don't think I'm all the way out of the slump, because I have no desire to pick up a book right now, but at least it was enough to finish this book.what also added to the fact was that I ADORED The Folk of the Air, and this was definitely not TFotA. I kept comparing the two books, which I knew I shouldn't have been doing but I couldn't help it. I couldn't get over Jurdan or the world or the plot.And then there was the actual book that caused me to dislike it.The PlotI think another factor that put me into the slump was the pacing. The beginning of this book just felt really slow- this is a traveling book which I typically have mixed feelings about because I like concrete settings and characters, and it really annoyed me in this one, which led into me having a slump.The things that I did love though were the mentions of Cardan and Jude- those few moments gave me life and I'm so excited to see them in the next book (yes, I am reading the next book because I want to read about Jude and Cardan so badly and I am a little curious about what happens)Thankfully I got back into the book like over halfway through, and the plot began to pick up a little bit, and the middle to end was wild.I'm also unsure how I feel about that ending. I'm kind of mad, because I was hoping it would save the book for me but it didn't. It just made me not like a certain character which is disappointing, because I already feel indifferent to the characters, which is also very disappointing.“It is hard to explain the savagery of hope.”The CharactersI miss Jude and Cardan beyond belief.I cannot picture Oak as a seventeen year old, I literally can't. And please don't remind me about his goat legs. I can excuse the horns, but the goat legs?? I loved Cardan's tail, but goat legs I just cannot imagine. I don't want to imagine them. But anyways, I kind of liked him I guess. He was cute at times, while other times he was really mysterious and you could tell Cardan taught him a few things. I honestly can't even think of a time he annoyed me, nor actually of a time he made me smile. I'd rather have a character who makes me mad than a character I feel nothing towards. GIVE ME CARDAN BACKI am also completely indifferent towards Suren/Wren. She does have a personality, an interesting one at that, but she also annoyed me, which I suppose is better than feeling nothing. The ending especially made me want to scream- she's bloodthirsty sure, but she can NEVER beat Jude. NO ONE beats Jude. I was so angry with her at the end that it literally ruined it for me, which is because I'm an extreme moodreader and let my emotions control me way too much. I must admit though, I felt terrible for her at times. What she had to go through was something no one should ever have to go through.I know nothing about Tiernan or Hyacinthe or whatever their names are, so I don't know what to say about those two.“The Folk adore Cardan, and they’re terrified of my sister, two excellent things. I hope they rule Elfhame for years and then pass it down to one of a dozen offspring. No need for me to be involved.”😭😭 Cardan and Jude >>>>>The RomanceNothing in the entire world will ever beat Cardan and Jude. You're probably thinking ""Avery, stop comparing the two, they aren't supposed to be alike!!"" and to that I say, I cannot stop myself and I honestly do not care anymore 😊But seriously, I feel like Wren and Oak didn't have much chemistry when they first kissed. Like, I felt no spark, nothing, zero zip nada. I really, really wish I could've loved them because I want to be invested in their relationship, especially after what happened at the end, but I literally cannot if I don't feel the chemistry. They have their cute moments, but I wanted so much more. Cardan and Jude were much more developed, mainly because they didn't kiss until much later but in this I couldn't really feel anything, like the flashbacks did nothing for me because I didn't care, which is upsetting.But anyways, I'm going to go cry into oblivion because I feel like a fool and I hate that I disliked this and now writing this out I want to rate the book lower because I realized that I like it much less than I thought I did. I'm so disappointed, especially since it's also my fault for not liking this because of my stupid head and brain, and I honestly hate myself for it.2.8 stars

<><><><><><><><><>honestly? i'm just glad it's over. and right now, i'm not even sad, i'm annoyed. i'd been hyped up for this book for MONTHS, and here i am, rating it 3 stars, which in my system isn't a high ratingthis book put me into an awful reading slump that caused me to have to read TWO of my favorite rom-coms, not even just one.rtc<><><><><><><><><>Haha guess who lied about the final edit edit: i finally have the book and i'm terrified i'm going to ruin it for myself because i can't get over Jurdan what's wrong with me 😭FINAL EDIT: HAPPY RELEASE DAY AHH. MY BOOK BETTER GET HERE SUPER FAST BECAUSE I WANT TO READ IT SO BADLY. I JUST WANT JURDAN MENTIONS PLEASEEE 🥳🥳 and yes I did stay up until midnight just to type this out right when it's the 3rd.Edit again again: I just read the exclusive first chapter for this and oh my gosh. Also I heard Jurdan doesn't show up till book 2?? I can't wait until the second book ughh. Also I heard something about a Jurdan baby??? Don't take this from me, I've just heard it around. I'm unsure how I feel about it. On one hand, I don't think Cardan and Jude would have a baby. On the other....I wouldn't mind it if they did. I don't know lol Edit edit: did y'all see the quotes that have been posted online?? I'm even more excitedEdit again: I just realized Taryn's kid is gonna be in this. I don't know how to feel about this. BUT I NEED MORE JURDAN PLEASEEEE I'M MAINLY COMING FOR JURDAN😍😍😍😍😍😍Edit: OMG There's a cover!! <33OMG, I AM FREAKING OUT. WE GET MORE ELFHAME, MORE OAK, AND I BEG OF YOU, PLEASE TELL ME THAT THERE WILL BE CARDAN AND JUDE APPEARANCES!!",311,8
The Stolen Heir,toointofiction,240,281,5,"When his eyes meet mine, desire, as keen as any blade, bends the air between us. The moment slows. I want to bite his lip. To feel the heat of his skin. To slide my hands beneath his armor and trace the map of his scars.

Leave it to Holly Black to drive me absolutely insane using only the written word. Damn, that was an exceptional book. I couldn't stop reading even if I wanted to. I actually grew accustomed to Holly Black keeping a slow pace, at least at the beginning of most of her books, but not in this case. The Stolen Heir starts right away and gets right to the point. It was a pleasant surprise. Not to mention the much darker turn it takes than its predecessor. Like...wow!! 👀👀 I did not see it coming. However, nothing, and I mean NOTHING, beats that cruel and unfair cliffhanger of an ending. Nothing!! In fact, I can picture Holly Black sipping tea with Satan and cackling loudly at the utter shock she has dealt us. My brain is splashed all over the walls.Moreover, I had no doubt whatsoever that Holly Black would absolutely nail her characters. Suren/Wren is incredible and painfully relatable at times. Her character arc is mind-blowing, even though she still has a long way to go. She goes from the weak, unassuming faerie who can't even hold her own among her people to a powerful queen who brings her enemies to their knees. In many ways, she reminds me of Jude, specifically her distrust of the Folk as she has learned their cruelty the hard way. She also constantly needs to outwit those around her, although she isn't as skilled as Jude, and be accepted by them. Not to mention, her complete inability to realize that the charismatic, pretty Prince of Elfhame is irrevocably in love with her. It was funny in The Folk of the Air and it is still funny now.Furthermore, Oak, the unsurprisingly enigmatic and alluring Prince of Elfhame, messy blend of Jude and Cardan in the most delightful way possible. He is strategic and cunning, and he runs face first at the sight of any danger without thinking at all of his safety, just like Jude. He is also charming and flirty, with that captivating smile that makes others leave logic behind. Besides, he hides a deeply passionate and loyal young man within, exactly like our favorite delicate alcoholic flower, Cardan. There wasn't much of a character development for Oak in this book, but that's because Holly Black is clearly saving it for book 2 which will be from Oak's point of view. I can't wait!!In addition, other than all the major plot twists in the book, there is another thing I did not see coming but probably should've; Oak and Suren steaming up every place they go to with their uncontrollable tension! Holy horny teenagers, Holly Black! What made this especially shocking was the fact that the last time we read about Suren and Oak they were just a couple of sweet, innocent little kiddies. Now, they are teenagers full of hormones, and some scenes between them had me shooketh. Besides, they have exceptional dynamics and chemistry, and while Jude and Cardan will always be No. 1 for me, Oak and Suren are definitely impressive as a couple and I am anxious to see how their relationship develops, especially after what happens in the end of this book. I'm not getting over that one until it's resolved in book two. Also, my favorite part of their relationship is not only that Suren just can't see how Oak truly feels about her, but she goes as far as to think that he hates her. This is the one parallel between Suren x Oak and Jurdan that I love the most.On that note, I can't finish this review without mentioning my all-time favorite fictional babies, Jude and Cardan. While they didn't have much of a presence in this book, they did not make a physical appearance once, every mere mention of them by anyone had me squealing in delight and joy. A lot of it captured their collective energy so perfectly it was like reliving The Folk of the Air series all over again. There is something so special about the way your favorite ship is perceived from other people's point of view. I love them so much and I can't wait to get more of them in the next book. According to the Black, they will actually make an appearance in book two, and I'm so excited I could scream.",312,0

The Stolen Heir,ellie,359,"2,827",2,"2.5 stars⭐️ biggest plot twist of 2023 so far is me giving a Holly Black book two stars. this is one of those books that is so boring and shallow that it drains your energy so that even being a hater feels like too much effort. usually, books i give this type of rating to end up being the recipient of my all-consuming loathing it stirred within me. but this was so bland that i can’t even really detail every which way this flopped.we all know Holly Black knows how to write tension and chemistry like no other. we have seen it, adored it, revelled in it, lost our damn minds reading it. so you’d think she’s be able to write a new set of characters who have tension and chemistry, right? right????it was genuinely painful, at times, to read the sheer lack of chemistry between Oak and Wren. it is truly astronomical how unromantic they are as a pairing. Holly Black puts very little effort into convincing us that we should be rooting for the pair— we get like two flashbacks to when they were kids and she thinks that makes up for the lack of bonding we get in the present. their connection was so surface level. and as a result the big cliffhanger ending has zero gut wrenching impact because they still felt like generic strangers. they weren’t anything special— no passion nor intensity, no pining or tension. i truly don’t know how to fully articulate the stale blandness of them lmao. no words that exist in my English vocabulary does their lack of chemistry justice. Oak was a flop. i truly couldn’t care less about him. he is not even worth my time. he felt like a caricature that needed so much more fleshing out. there was nothing unique about him, nothing that i found riveting or special. Wren was a disappointment. she was set up to be this feral unhinged little weirdo that was gonna provide us with some fun af energy. but half the time she was just like an empty shell with no real thoughts or feelings or motivations (and i will admit there is a slight spoiler that could explain this but i don’t think it was actually Holly Black’s intent to make her this dull💀). she was so incredibly passive when she had the potential to be far more complex than what she was. whenever she was presented with an issue, a betrayal, an attack etc. it’s like she had the memory of a goldfish and forgot why she shouldn’t trust a certain person or why she should run away. her backstory in the beginning was set up to be so fascinating (then the reveals about her later were fun af too), but none of it really goes anywhere? there’s so much info-dumping that it was very overwhelming— one of my friends legit had to send me voice notes to explain the plot to me because my brain was scrambled it was that confusing. the plot doesn’t make sense or become interesting until like the final 10%? also the amount of conversations that the characters all apparently had but we’re not privy to them drove me insane😭 no wonder im not convinced of the connections and the depth of the story when you don’t show me them all bonding?! it’s likely why i wasn’t attached to anyone or convinced of the depth of the characters and the their dynamics. i ultimately feel like this could have been fleshed out waaaaay more. this felt like a rough first draft and not a finished manuscript ready for publication.disappointed is an understatement.",268,0
The Stolen Heir,Phuong ✯,653,"7,276",2,"– 2 starsthe first disappointment of the year goes to The Stolen Heir!i tried to not go into this book with high expectation, because there is just no way Holly Black can top judecardan. but then how can i not go into this book with certain expectations, cause THIS IS THE WOMEN WHO CREATED JUDECARDAN!?!?!needless to say, the book didn’t meet my expectations. i was excited to be back in Elfame, but my excitement for this fantasy world quickly vanished. Wren/Suren and Oak are different than Jude and Cardan (as they should be), but they are not very compelling to read about. Holly Black tried to make Wren another girlboss, but it’s not enough to only show that in the last couple of chapters for a shocking ending, when for the most part of the book all Wren does is whine that she wants to be loved. Oak on the other hand … apparently he is very charming. a feat everyone and their mother tells me, but i don’t really see it?just the cherry on top of this dull book is that Jude and Cardan are mentioned quite a lot of times, but never make an appearance in the book. I WAS ROBBED YOUR HONOR!!! in conclusion, High Queen Jude and High King Cardan stole the show without even appearing and that’s a fact. 💅 will be reading the next book in my continued quest for judecardan crumbs. 🤡",262,0
The Stolen Heir,Margaret M - Back properly in Feb - (so much catching up to do),513,"1,403",4,"“I had heard the stories, but it was another thing to be inside it, to feel it surround me”And this is the new fantasy world of ‘Stolen Heir’ ruled by terror and greed, inhabited by a plethora of fantastical creatures like trolls, stick creatures, falcon soldiers, hooved men, and the invisible occupants of Stone forest, but with the same intrigue and eagerly waited endings that Holly Black is known for.This is a story and a journey involving, among others, Wren / Suren and Oak / The Prince of Elfhame, an emotional one, a coming of age, and a mission to return 'Mellith's heart which requires a physical journey and one where battles are numerous and the terrain is unforgiving. The Plot  Wren is a child isolated and continually hunted by the tormenters of the ‘Court of Teeth’ (a bit off the wall but anyway). The prince is a flatterer, a charmer but most of all a deceiver, which keeps a tension between Wren and Oak throughout the story. From the moment they meet, until we come to that shocking ending we are kept pondering who really is “the deceiver” and “the deceived”? in an unpredictable and action-packed conclusion to this first part of the duology.This book is a journey, of different kinds. One physical as the main characters make their way through the treacherous landscape of the Stone forest, with various courts at play but the other is the journey of the friendship and budding romance between Wren and Oak that captivates the reader. Wren’s journey requires one thing and that is to trust Oak again. A young man who has betrayed her once and is set to again, but this time their feelings towards each other are tested and challenged as the chemistry ignites but the notions of trust are as ever - illusive.Review and Comments  There isn't much of a plot to write about but that is not to say there is anything missing. why says you? The whole book is a journey with lots of events happening en route. It is action packed with many twists and surprises, and the reader is left in suspense as to the real purpose of this mission. This has great character development, particularly within Wren, who strangely enough I absolutely love as a character, and praise to Holly Black for creating a central female character that does not confirm to the stereotypical badass 'bitch' in Fantasy stories. It was Oak that got on my 'goat' at times - sorry for the pun. I'd like to see some heroism in him, you know 'man up' instead of all this 'hoofing' around - sorry I've done it again!!!Love Holly Black as a Fantasy writer, along with Sarah J Maas of course. So if you are interested in Fantasy, The folk of Air series is wonderful and this is shaping up to being another exciting series, but just bear in mind Holly Black starts slow.Imaginative, action packed, and such a joy to read.",220,0

The Stolen Heir,PoppyflowerJJ ,217,,5,"5/5 ⭐0/5 🌶️The Stolen Heir is the first book of Holly Black's planned Stolen Heir Duology. The main characters are Wren and Oak. I am so excited to be back in Elfhame and in the lands of faerie. I did tear up once or twice, I really feel for Wren. Her characters is raw, real and painful. I loved the writing, the familial angst/trauma, the riddles and twists and turns. And Oak. His characters is stunning with just enough cruelty, betrayal, faerie cunning of a cruel prince but with new twists and heartbreak. The second installment is going to be perfect! Holly Black is the queen of betrayals, secrets and cleverly concealed lies.Quotes: “I have little hope that will chase her off, but I have little hope at all.”“It would be safer if I hated him. Since I cannot, perhaps it is good that he now hates me.”“He’s the kind of beautiful that makes people want to smash things.”“My sister thinks that she’s the only one who can take poison, but I am poison,” he whispers, eyes half-closed, talking to himself. “Poison in my blood. I poison everything I touch.”“My greatest weakness has always been my desire for love. It is a yawning chasm within me, and the more that I reach for it, the more easily I am tricked. I am a walking bruise, an open sore. If Oak is masked, I am a face with all the skin ripped off. Over and over, I have told myself that I need to guard against my own yearnings, but that hasn’t worked.” “Fear is not love, but it can appear much the same.”",215,2

The Stolen Heir,Bryce Rocks My Socks,445,729,5,"was this as good as cruel prince? no. just thought id start the review with that in case that's all u wanted to know. (ur welcome) (i accept thanks in the form of cash).im not going to lie i bought this book without reading the summary. i was like OMG JUDE AND CARDAN *add to cart*. when i found out it was about oak when he was older i was 1. disappointed i wouldn't see any Jardan action (Cude?) and 2. grossed out. why would i want to read a romance with jude's baby brother in some rando's POV? i still thought of him as the little horned baby laughing and pulling tricks on jude. but once u are able to picture him not as a child, BOY HE IS HOT. (that was a very weird and problematic sentence so lets just move on).i saw so much of Cardan in Oak, i actually had to think back to if they were related (they're not) (that would be weird) (ok update they are) (and it is weird). the flirtatiousness, the drunkenness, the carelessness about his own safety. oak is cardan if he went to finishing school and learned some freaking manners. (don't get me wrong, cardans lack of manners and conscience and doing the responsible thing is what i loved most about him) (also his tail).and so much jude in wren. the way it felt like reading about cardan and jude in another timeline. the coming from the mortal world, having to team up with a Folk royal... what i loved most about jude in cruel prince was the shit she gave cardan and BOY did wren do oak dirty at times. they both did. and i loved it. holly black is so good and making the characters we love hurt each other. they hurt each other it hurt me and i had so much fun while it was happening.the way i don't see anyone on my feed talking about this book. either yall are seriously missing out or GoodReads algorithm is fucked. its probably GoodReads. it's always GoodReads. stay safe out there kids. ok and unrelated but does the Bogdana remind anyone else of a cross between the bone carver and the weaver from ACOTAR??",180,0

This was so dull, so fucking boring it's a miracle I finished it. If you ask me what happened in the book, I won't be able to tell a single thing. I wasn't expecting tfota at all. But I wasn't expecting this either. WHERE WAS THE CHEMISTRY!? THE TENSION??? THERE WAS NOTHING. I wouldn't have minded that if the plot and the characters had been tolerable. But they weren't.I was told Wren was supposed to be a baddie but I'm sorry all I saw was a girl so bland she nearly made me cry. I get that she's got a traumatic past and honestly, it just made me want to see her go absolutely unhinged on everyone's asses but I was robbed of it. I'm not even counting the last chapters because she was mediocre at best even then.You know how when you've got a crush and you show your friends their picture gushing about them and then your friends would just go ""THIS HIM!? 🧐""That was me whenever Wren was talking about Oak because-1. I couldn't imagine him as this 17 year old boy. He was still BABEY for me for most of the book.2. BITCH WHERE!?? WHERE WAS THE PERSONALITY???!?Don't even get me started on the romance because was there any romance???!? It felt so forced, so disappointing, to say the least. Like I said, I wasn't expecting JudeCardan level chemistry but gimme something here ffs.The plot twist was okay. I don't really care about it. The JudeCardan mentions were my only respite. If I do read the next book, it'd be only for them istg.__________________I FINALLY HAVE THIS IN MY HANDSSSSS 😭please dont disappoint 🛐___________________ive never called myself patient ive an aries stellium what more can u expect but seeing everyones updates while waiting for my copy to arrive is testing my patience like no other 😭",164,0

The Stolen Heir,SK,380,"5,185",3,"Am kinda shocked that this was just an average read for me considering how much I loved the Folk of the Air series. But I partly blame myself for jumping into Oak's story so quickly, when my mind was clearly full of Jurdan content and I believe that affected my interest levels a lot.  What I liked-   ✅ Plot-  It was really interesting. I liked how we got more insights to Oak and how he grew up and what really was going on in his mind.  ✅ Characters-  Although am not a fan of Oak and Wren as much as I was of Cardan and Jude and they don't create the same magic as them, I still appreciated their zeal. Tho Oak tries too hard and Wren is a complex character, I liked their dynamics.  ✅ Ending-  I liked it a lot, especially the betrayal that came with it. That makes me look forward to the next book in the duology.  What I didn't like-   ❌ Pacing-  It was extremely slow, especially in the first half. It picked up a bit in the second half but not for long. I was bored in the first half cause of this and it's something I cannot avoid while rating this book.  ❌ Long chapters-  Compared to the Folk of the Air series, this one has such lengthy chapters. It sort of made me not want to read it cause if you pair it with the slow pacing, it's a deadly combination in my opinion 🥲Overall, it's an okay-ish read but I would recommend not reading it immediately after The Folk of the Air series.~•~•~Am so glad I bought the paperback, don't have to wait to read it 🥺",134,0
The Stolen Heir,Gillian,172,252,4,"4.5 stars! “When his eyes meet mine, desire, as keen as any blade, bends the air between us. The moment slows. I want to bite his lip. To feel the heat of his skin.”I’m obsessed! This was an epic and enchanting young adult fantasy about betrayal, love, power and desire. This book follows Suren, the daughter of the queen of the Court of Teeth and Prince Oak as they go on a journey to stop Suren's mother and save Oak's father. Along the way Suren faces new enemies and meets potential allies. This book is from Suren's point of view. The plot was so exciting and the pacing was perfect. I loved the magical world full of fae, trolls, knights, witches, and princes. I love the author's writing style and the writing transported me into this enchanting world from the very beginning. The characters are so complex and relatable. I love Oak, he is charming, very handsome, cunning and brave. I really like Suren, she is strong, clever, brave, cunning and stubborn. The character development was great, I loved seeing different sides to both Suren and Oak and watching them grow. The chemistry and sexual tension between Oak and Suren was amazing. There were so many betrayals and plot twists that I didn't see coming. The ending was so shocking and exciting! I'm speechless! I can't wait to read the next book!",127,0
The Great Transition,Terrie  Robinson,499,939,3,"The Great Transition by Nick Fuller Googins is a Speculative and Dystopian Fiction Story!The Great Transition was a 'rag-tag' global movement that inspired the world to save the planet from going under due to climate change. The post-Transition is considered to be utopian-like compared to past generations.Emi Vargas was born post-Transition, her parents, Kristina and Larch, were both instrumental in building the new society. Now a teenager, they tell her often how lucky she is to have been born after the climate crisis but Emi doesn't know life any other way.Suddenly chaotic occurrences takes place concerning climate criminals and Kristina mysteriously goes missing. Emi begins to wonder how safe her life really is in this utopian-like society... The Great Transition is this author's debut novel and I was hoping for more of a connection with the story, as Speculative and Dystopian Fiction are favorite genres for me. My preference is always a character-driven story and what I found was primarily plot-driven. Getting to know the Vargas family was difficult as not much was offered with the exception of conflict. Connecting with the secondary characters was tough as none were likable or relatable. There was a great deal of focus on the backstory, which I enjoyed, but little substance in the current timeline. There was a lot of telling and talking about climate change, and honestly, it felt over-the-top.The Great Transition has a creative premise with loads of potential and I enjoyed the author's writing style. I'm glad to see the many positive reviews and ratings for this debut novel. Sadly, I was looking for a better connection to the story overall.2.75⭐rounded up for the premise!Thank you to NetGalley, Atria Books, and Nick Fuller Googins for an DRC of this book.

The Great Transition,Nancy,"1,564",389,5,"Just when I thought I was through with dystopian climate change fiction, along comes a novel so immersive, so well conceived, and frightening believable that I can’t stop thinking about its implications.Take everything thing wrong with today’s world, the trajectory of where things are going, and follow it to its most awful fulfillment: the internet merely MemeFeed, the rich using the working classes to protect it’s wealth, wildfires barraging over land that isn’t flooded by collapsing ice sheets. After great devastation, millions of climate refugees treated worse than animals, Earth reaches Net Zero, the Great Transition accomplished. It took the hard labor and sacrifice of volunteer workers to pull it off, like Emi’s parents, reality star hero dad fighting fires, her mom separated from her family as a child in the immigrant camps, risking her life for the cause and a heroine in her own right.Now a father, Emi’s dad takes on the role of protector and primary parent, while her mom bristles at his complacency and constantly reminds Emi of the horror of the past and that society must stay vigilant, continuing the fight. Mom regularly volunteers for duty in New York City, while Dad’s job in Nuuk allows him to give stability to Emi.Underground groups deal out delayed justice, targeting climate enemies for murder, octogenarian capitalists who never paid for their crimes against the Earth.With mom gone, Emi convinces her dad to allow her to see the Great Transition celebration that her mother has forbade them to attend. Violence breaks out, and the whole world as Emi knew it collapses. With her father, Emi goes searching for her mom, encountering a shifting reality of good and evil, the journey a refining experience of growth and understanding.This reads like a thriller, and hits hard with a political punch.Thanks to the publisher for a free book. My review is fair and unbiased.",31,5
The Great Transition,Shannon,"5,166",276,5,"This was a standout debut domestic thriller set in a post-climate change world in which the planet has achieved net zero emissions after a costly revolution. Told in a dual timeline narrative, we get to know Emi Vargas in the present and how her parents helped turn the tide for climate change in the past.While Emi often feels estranged from her politically active mother, she doesn't hesitate to team up with her father to track her down and clear her name when she gets framed for an assassination and suddenly disappears. Full of secrets, espionage, family drama and so much more.This was also EXCELLENT on audio narrated by Stacy Carolan and Stacy Gonzalez and perfect for fans of books like Station Eleven by Emily St John Mandel or Landscapes by Christine Lai.

The Great Transition,Lilli (LitbyLilli),519,87,2,"I really wanted to love it! The comp titles are some of my favorites, and I really love dystopian, climate-fiction novels. However, I did not like this one really at all. I found the alternating POVs and alternating timelines to be confusing. I usually like alternating POVs, but with the added timeline in the past it was hard to figure out which Larch chapters were in the present and which were in the past. I had to read a couple pages of each of his chapters to figure that out. I also didn't like any of the characters. I found Emi to be annoying while also kind of sympathetic. I think the added plot-line of her eating disorder was not handled well and frankly was confusing, I didn't understand why the author included it. Emi's mother, Kristina, was incredibly unlikeable. She's supposed to be this hero-type character, but she is not personable. The author, I think, tries to humanize her, but he doesn't successfully dive into her trauma. I think maybe Larch, Emi's father, is potentially the only likable character, but I didn't love him. I found the pacing of the book to be off. Googins does a really great job of setting a descriptive scene for what the world looks like after climate change goes unchecked. That said, some of the descriptions were too long, while others were too short. Then, at about 70% into the novel, the book makes a turn for the ~thriller~ genre, and I was not on board. It felt rushed. Overall, I think this book has GREAT potential and brings up A LOT of super important topics. The themes and multiple POVs would be FANTASTIC for a book club. I do wish I had read the novel with others because, while I didn't love the book, I do think there is a ton of value to such a realistic climate fiction novel.",15,0

The Great Transition,Melodi | booksandchicks ,770,57,4,"Such a unique climate fiction book about the after effects of a deteriorated and fallen earth! Emi and her parents now live on Greenland living a pretty ""normal"" life post The Great Transition. We follow 3 POV's of Emi, her mother told through a school report that Emi is writing and her father sharing his past. The world had succumbed to the devastating effects of climate failure....but...people banded together and worked hard to begin the Great Transition where missions were led, similar to a military mission, to go to the inner world, such as NYC or Colorado, to repair the effects of the fallen world due to climate devastation. The hope and intent is to repair the damage done so it can hopefully thrive and repair itself over time. This is not a heavy subject point of the book but helps you know the world that you're walking into.The book has a strong sense of family, a good mystery with a twist keeping you on the edge of your seat at times, and some humor along the way as Emi is into the oldies such as Adele, Brittney, Queen and Nirvana. Climate fiction is really hit or miss for me, but I do have to say this is the best climate fiction I've read. I loved that it was AFTER the devastation of the climate crisis and focused on recovery and life after. It never felt too devastating or heavy, but perhaps motivates a person to reconsider your personal footprint here on the earth.Thank you to NetGalley and Atria books for the complimentary e-book.",10,0
The Great Transition,Sean,154,63,5,"I am a ""First Reads"" winner. Thank you to the author and publisher.I was hooked immediately after reading the first few pages of Fuller Googins 'The Great Transition' - a sometime-in-the future dystopian tale that references U2, Dolly Parton, Madonna, and Prince? ... I'm in!And later, when the author provides a backdrop for 'The Great Transition,' I found myself thinking how we - now, today - might be able to impact the change imagined in the novel: ""People were desperate. Fed up. The old parties had so spectacularly failed. People who had never a reason to vote were lining up to throw the bums out. To cast a ballot for something new"" (p. 81).'The Great Transition' is a thought-provoking, well-written and imagined read that ends with an exuberant sense of hope. Very recommended.",10,0

The Great Transition,Sanjida,428,38,2,"This novel starts off intriguing and fresh. Maybe I was a sucker for a young narrator and old school pop music references. And then. I got really annoyed by the writing. The sentences. Short and fragmented. For no reason. But I slogged. Slogged through it.I thought I would find the flashbacks to The Transition years interesting, but they became tedious and repetitive, and I began to dread them. The ""now"" sections are faster paced, but become absurd eventually, a thriller plot that isn't well thought out. The author is trying to have some deep thoughts about justice versus peace, but it's obvious where he stands and it ends up being polemical and alienating to those who don't share his views. Maybe there's also too much tell not show, like of course the reader will agree with the author on why the bad guys are bad. No nuance needed. But if a post scarcity, worker-owned zero carbon society isn't good enough, then maybe that's a you problem, Kristina.

The Great Transition,AndiReads,"1,177",127,5,"A BEST book of the year! For sure sure sure!The Great Transition refers to a post apocalyptic world where much of the control has been wrested away from the 1%. The transition took place while much of the world had gone under in flooding or up in flames and it's been just enough time that people are beginning to forget just how bad it was. This is the setting when we meet 15 year old Emi and her parents Larch and Kristina. Larch and Kristina were part of the revolution and have moved considerably apart in their believes. Their political tug of war leaves Emi in the middle and is part of the reason of her anxiety. When a series of vigilante events cause mayhem around the world, Larch realizes he may not know everything about his wife. Told through several points of view, a variety of flashback and a very poignant school project, we learn how Larch and Kristina met and fought for the world. Best yet, Fuller Googins presents everyone's points of view and they characters are so real you think you will see them this week at work. The only question really is, which character would you turn out to be?I loved this story and just hope for more of the same! If you love dystopia, contemporary criticism and strong characters you will absolutely love The Great Transition!#Atriabooks NickFullerGoogins #TheGreatTransition",7,0
The Great Transition,Allyson Gilliam,218,204,4,"Really thought provoking and enjoyable debut. This novel takes place after the rebuilding of society — known as the “great transition” — after a global warming crisis and fallout. Wildfires and hurricanes destroyed the planet in a very realistic and believable way (which I feel was a smart move as it evoked a very sobering and visceral feeling as a reader). The focus is on a family of 3: a young girl in high school and her two parents. The mother/wife of this trio is a fascinating, albeit it extremely hardened, character who is well known worldwide for leading the entire movement to rebuild a better world. You receive flashbacks of her years of trauma within this crumbling society and how she ultimately fights back against the corrupt government leaders, who she feels are to blame for the downfall by failing to act for years. Throughout the book, in the present day timeline, the mother works “undercover” in a way, continuing to fight back and ultimately goes missing. The bulk of the book is the father and daughter traveling back to America to find her. The POV of the daughter was maybe my favorite, as it was so relatable and symbolic to how millennials and GenZers tend to be treated by older generations. She now lives in the aftermath — a world rebuilt, peace restored, things “better than they’ve ever been.” As such, her mother (and father) who lived through the tragedy remind her daily how “good” she has it, with a “stop your complaining,” “you have no idea how lucky you are” attitude. As a result, the daughter suppresses feelings of anxiety, hides her panic attacks, and begins to suffer from severe disordered eating (never defined, but read as anorexia). It was really poignant and begs the questions: Should we punish and scold the younger generations for having it “easier” than us? Because what defines easy? And who is to say they are not suffering? TW: disordered eating scenes (ranging from internal dialogue, food restricting, to some scenes of vomiting) Thank you Atria for this advanced copy - released August 2023.",6,0
The Great Transition,Lori,"1,541",55.8k,4,"The Great Transition, which releases this August, was recommended to me as a review copy from the publisher and I read it on my kindle while travelling to Virginia this past weekend. In it, we follow teenaged Emi and her mother and father, Kristina and Larch, as they continue to acclimate within the post-Transition world. Some backstory for context: sixteen years ago the world was on the verge of a full out collapse, referred to as The Crisis. Rather than allow climate criminals to continue to poison the earth, pockets of workers, migrants, and refugees across the globe stood together to save the planet. And Emi's parents were key proponents of that famous revolution. Now, as Day Zero arrives, a holiday in which everyone parties in the streets together to celebrate the reversal of the Crisis, an unexpected attack takes place in the heart of their city and Emi's mother goes missing. The storyline abruptly shifts from climate fiction to eco-thriller as Emi and her father try to locate Kristina and in the process, begin to realize just how little they know her or understand the kind of danger they both may be in. Told in flip-flopping storylines that alternate between the perspectives of Emi and Larch, while also bouncing between past and present to build up the reader's understanding of the historic roles both Kristina and Larch played during the Crisis, the flashback chapters became a frequent source of frustration. The deeper into the book we got, the more the flashbacks appeared, which interuppted the forward momentum we were experiencing in the present chapters and created a very choppy, start-and-stop reading flow to the novel. In spite of that, The Great Transition warns us of the risks of becoming complacent, of ignoring the damage we're causing or waiting for someone else to take it on as ""their problem"". It's a dystopian survivalist story that shows us what's potentially to come if we continue to choose momentary comforts over a more planet-healthy and sustainable way of life.",6,0
The Great Transition,Camelia Rose,721,98,3,"I am glad to see that because more and more writers address the issue of climate change, a new sub-genre has emerged: cli-fi, speculative fiction that imagines how we, as human race, react to the climate disasters brought upon by ourselves. The Great Transition by Nick Fuller Googins is one of them. After decades of warning signs, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet finally collapses. Global sea level rises above 3 meters. All major coastal cities are lost. Yet, instead of descending to total chaos, the world (especially the US) kind of pulls through and survives. Are American people capable of seeing what truly matters and unite across color and religion lines?  The Great Transition is set in a post-climate-change world that has been utterly changed by climate disasters and the “great transition” afterwards.It’s rare to find a near-future speculative fiction about climate change that is not dystopia. Although it is not an utopia, it has a positive atmosphere with a mixed socialism and capitalism flavor. Yet, the repeated “revolution is not a dinner party” by one of the characters just makes me cringe. My biggest problem is that the main character Emi, a teenage girl and a child of survivors, has anorexia. How utterly impossible. Anorexia is a modern, western phenomenon influenced by popular but unhealthy body images. It is socially contagious and only thrives in a world that has abundance of food. None of these apply to a society that barely survived a world ending disaster. Quotes:P103:""I remember one study that got some attention after the Transition--it showed how suicides had dropped in direct relationship to enrollment numbers. Especially young people. Especially young men. I believe it. Sometimes heading back after pouring concrete all night by floodlight–the sky glowing red with dawn–the ferry captain would pull the horn for no good reason and we would all raise a fist and launch into “This Land Is Your Land” or some other song.

The Great Transition,Fred Forbes,"1,021",57,3,"Ever heard the expression ""jumped the shark""? It is the moment a TV series begins it's descent from greatness. Refers to an episode of ""Happy Days"" where the Fonz, the cool motorcycle guy, jumps over a caged shark on water skis. The show was never the same. It seems to me that one way to cause a show to jump the shark is to insert kids into the plot - think ""Mad About You"", ""The Closer"", ""Major Case"", ""NCIS Hawaii"", and others. Once the kid gets involved, particularly if it is a snarky teenager, some of the narrative drive dissipates. Such is the case here. (Note that stories mainly about kids, the Potter series, for example, and some excellent Young Adult writing are not what I am referring too.)The pattern of the teen daughter's interview with her mother - ""My Mom, Me, My Mom, Me"" was driving me batty in the audio version, probably not as distracting in the print version.I am also not a big fan of vigilante domestic terrorists - if the world collapses as it does here, it will be all of our faults, our unwillingness to change world threatening habits, not just a few greedy capitalists who bring us to grief so hunting them down for assassination is not a cause I can get behind. Tough for me to work up much sympathy for those chasing them down.Given the positive reviews, a lot of folks enjoyed this story, just not for me.",4,0
The Great Transition,Oleksandr Zholud,"1,200",119,3,"This is a debut cli-fi/SF/post-apoc thriller, set in the world that started actively work to prevent further degradation of the environment and reverse some of its negative effects. I read it as a part of the monthly reading for December 2023 at  SFF Hot from Printers: New Releases group.The book starts by outlining the main characters and the world around them. We meet a family, which consists of a 15-year-old girl Emiliana (Emi) Vargas, a fan of the oldies music (before the Great Transition) with eating distortion, that is likely a guilt that she cannot fight for a better world, as both her parents have done. Her mom Kristina was one of the initial firebrands that started to change the world and is still driven by the idea to stop degradation of the environment and punish the guilty. She tries to grow Emi stronger, assuming that an easy life will make her soft. Her dad Larch, who was a minor celebrity of the movement (his backstory is told later), now works as a community cook and dietary specialist of a local sports team and he is the one who stays with Emi while Kristina is away. Now Kristina once again plans to leave for another important project, warning her (mostly estranged) husband and daughter not to go at Day Zero (or Z-day) celebrations. They assume it is just her anger about complacency and self-congratulations when so much is yet to be done, and go anyway. When Larch drops her a video of happy dancing Emi, Kristina commands them to leave immediately, but its too late: a bunch of drones shot local dignitaries. As it turns out, an organization called Furies decided to assassinate the ‘criminal class’, who profited from the destruction of the eco-sphere and then united with rebels, who like a wave throw away the old world.The characters are fleshed-out, the story is well-paced and while narrated by Larch and Emi, it doesn’t distract the flow. For a debut novel, it is quite solidly done. And while I fully support one of the messages – “the Great Transition was essential for our survival, but should have started decades, or even a century, earlier”, I’m much less convinced that the depicted communalist society will effectively work for a long time. I just know a lot about failed experiments in the 1920s USSR, where groups of enthusiasts tried to build a new society from themselves – most of them weren’t squeezed out by the secret police or the like. In particular, the question of taking good housing from exploitive classes and giving to the poor is well outlined in наказание жилищем: Жилищная политика в СССР как средство управления людьми 1917-1937, which I reviewed here. The story, while claiming to depict the whole world is so US-centric… a small example, Emi “I have her pick any year, any place on earth, and I recite the top song at that time.” But actually she listens to Western music (from Prince to Nirvana to Chuck Berry) but never mentions Chinese, Indian, Latin American etc. musicians. This is a minor detail, but it hides a larger problem – for a lot of the world the question of environmental degradation is not the most important for today – say the number of people affected by hunger is highest on the African continent where 20% of the population don’t get enough to eat. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 1 in 3 children experience stunted growth because they don’t get enough food or vitamins. And while, yes, definitely, one of the important sources is climate change, halting the extraction of hydrocarbons overnight will worsen their situation.",4,0
The Great Transition,Marilynn,50,7,5,"I have learned a lot reading Climate Fiction and this novel leaves me hungry for more. With a family drama overlay, this is a very timely read during hottest summer on record, Canadian forest fires that will burn for months and an expected Saharan dust storm headed my way. (This is my real life.) Things are a bit worse in this story, and we watch as a family struggles to understand their roles in the changing world following a total collapse of the environment and the early stages of rebuilding a world with zero emissions. I loved the believability of this story and the book unfolded like a movie in my mind. Dual timelines were clear; thank you, dear author. In the way that Fahrenheit 451 is still relevant today, this book has a very important message about our planet. I LOVED the crisp writing style of this thoroughly enjoyable novel. Thank you to Net Galley for an early copy of this novel.",4,0
The Great Transition,Leah (Jane Speare),"1,430",430,5,"4.5 Reading this book made me ask myself where we draw the line nowadays at dystopian stories versus near-future or could-be-tomorrow stories. I'd say the strongest comparison is Station Eleven in human-dynamics, meets The Road in writing style. Making this a pretty darn impressive debut novel.That being said, it's one of those near-future books that will not comfort you, not really bring you hope that we will figure things out eventually. Instead it reads like a cautionary tale and asks where we draw the line at justifiable actions. Climate criminals (oil companies, billionaires, etc) are responsible for the state of this planet; they know what they are doing and promoting is harming millions of people and will likely never see consequences for those actions. Emi's mother is part of a group that assassinates climate criminals. During this fictional transition period (between the collapse of society as we know it and a new system rising in its place) while the world's populace did stop the absolute worst from happening to the planet, all the people responsible still got away with it. And in this almost-dystopia, Emi's mom is of the mind that the semi-recovering state that they live in right now is too precarious to enjoy and moving forward cannot happen until the perpetrators of the apocalypse are dead and unable to continue the cycle.If we look at this book as a how-to for dystopian times, it causes some questions: like how do we balance enjoying life (you only live once!) and contributing in acts of (violent) justice - whatever that may look like. Complacency is dangerous, but to not even enjoy living in the world...what's the point? Where's the line between the two? I was angry at Emi's mom most of the time for her harshness and never giving up the battle...but I also understood it. I'm not sure what I would have done in her shoes. Her trauma through the transition shaped who she was and I can't judge that. Overall, this is an important book to read at this time and climate, but it was also uncomfortable to see this easily-possible imaginative future world that made me think maybe we wouldn't get through all this intact.Major TW for eating disorder for the child, Emi.",4,0
The Great Transition,,,,,"Just what I was looking for: an optimistic-but-realistic, deeply considered (and deeply researched) story of a climate-change future. No endless power hungry corrupt governments, no we're-eating-each-other-and-shanking-each-other-with-truck-leaf-spring-shivs future, but rather a story of committed groups and movements struggling through the hard work of building a better future, and the ways communities and families come together (and get pulled apart) by forces bigger than themselves.",4,0
The Great Transition,Kim McGee,"3,149",76,4,"If, or in this case when, we cut emissions to zero to halt the ever looming climate disasters what would that world look like? In this debut one possible future is explored. As part of the Great Transition everyone worked together to achieve zero emissions and a new society of cooperative help and awareness was born. Larch and his wife Kristina remember the world before Day Zero as they fell in love in a hospital after being injured fighting wildfires but this is the only world their teenage daughter Emi has ever known. While she is still concerned with getting her term project finished and trying to figure out her parents her world is shaken when a terrorist attack occurs and her mom, named a suspect is missing. Not knowing who to trust or what they will learn, they set out to find Kristina and get answers. This speculative story of our future focuses on a positive outcome to what will be a frightening reality of climate disasters to come while keeping us tethered to characters that we can all relate to. Scary and hopeful in equal measure this will appeal to science fiction readers as well as those who want a family drama with deep dives into the characters. It is a story that both young adult and adult audiences need to read now. My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy.",4,0
The Great Transition,Cat,44,6,5,"For a review, I will just copy the text of the DM I sent the author on instagram. I might have gone on a bit too long, but that’s okay. I was fortunate enough to get an ARC from my local bookstore as a giveaway, and read it in a day (when I should have been grading). Thank you for writing a book that takes a clear eyed view of the possible (and likely) tragedies to come but also for giving so much hope. I’m working on a proposal to teach a science fiction literature course at the high school I work at, and I’m already planning to find a way to make it a cornerstone novel for one of the units. I have a 16 year old and the hopelessness that their generation struggles with (because the world is on fire, so who cares about they do in their future, they won’t be alive to see it) is sometimes overwhelming. Your novel gives hope, in a real way. Good science fiction asks and proposes what it means to be human, but the very best asks and proposes what we owe to each other. Yours is in the latter category. Thank you. Sincerely, this was my favorite book of the last several years, and I read a LOT (HS English teacher).",4,0
The Great Transition,Henry Chan,21,,5,5 stars.A fun read. Great character work. Larch is probably the best written character I’ve read all year. I thought his relationship with Kristina was pretty nuanced and you could empathize with both characters. First climate fiction novel I’ve read and I appreciate that it’s still hopeful despite all the awful things that happen. A little unsettling to read this while we live through our own climate crisis.,4,0
The Great Transition,Jessica,93,,5,"I absolutely adored this book. Many thanks to Atria Books and Netgalley for the ARC, and to Water Street Books in Exeter NH for recommending this so highly!Here are five things I loved about this five star read:1) The prose was wonderful. It truly set the scene, and adapted to fit each character well. I’m actually kind of sad this is a debut because I would like to read more books by this author ASAP.2) The dual POVs were very strong. At first I wished we had Kristina’s as well, but the further I got in, the more glad I was we didn’t because it heightened the mystery aspect of the plot, and because I think we got just enough of her motivations (especially through the essay device used) from the others’. I loved how they were balanced, and how each character’s motivations, needs, and actions were realistic for their personalities (even when they were diametrically opposed from one another).3) The references to pop culture from our current time and recent past grounded the story in the real world, which made it all the more frightening.4) I never felt the author was over-explaining the world of his story, which is rampant in a lot of speculative/science fiction. The reader gets just enough information at the right time to propel the story along, and to keep them invested.5) Reading this during the ongoing crisis in Maui has been especially eye opening and powerful because it shows that the events of this story can happen, and likely will continue to if we don’t do something. Climate change is one of the biggest threats to our lives right now and if we, as a global community, don’t act as soon as possible, it will be too late. We only have one world and we need to save it. I can’t recommend this book enough. The Great Transition is out today!",3,0
The Great Transition,Laurel,363,11,5,"“We don’t get to choose which battles we’re born into,” she says. “The only thing we get is to choose what we'll do. Will we join the fight? Or will we turn our backs?”This might be the best book I read all year. This utopian climate fiction (cli-fi) spans many years and places through the lives of several intertwined characters and paints a vivid portrait of our planet in the not-so-distant future through compelling and relatable characters. It’s one of very few books I might want to read again.",3,0
The Great Transition,Laura,84,8,5,"Holy shit, this is EXACTLY the kind of book I've been looking for: a plausible vision of a society that overthrows capitalism and extractivism, prevents the worst of climate collapse, and builds a just, sustainable, democratic world in the ruins of the old one. It does all this without sugarcoating just how messy the process of transformation is, or how bad things can get before it starts - how many losses are already unavoidable. It grapples with the emotional impacts of living through such upheaval and fighting the entrenched forces of the ""destroying classes"" (I love that term), how those impacts affect relationships and families and how they pass down the trauma to the next generation. It also grapples with questions of accountability, how to balance celebrating victories with staying vigilant, how to truly prevent the destroying classes from taking over again, what actions are justifiable in order to save not only the people you love, but the whole planet. Unlike other books similar I've tried to read and found dissatisfying, the book tells the story of mass protest movements, unions, and the major disruption necessary to transform society. The author truly *gets* the amount of upheaval, disruption, and solidarity necessary to make change on such an enormous scale. This is a book that's informed by labor organizing, climate justice, mutual aid, Indigenous sovereignty, migrant justice, eco-socialism, and more. It's a well-researched and frighteningly plausible vision of just how bad things can get before we manage to transform society, as well as an ultimately hopeful vision of how we can prevent the worst of climate collapse and build a better world.Also, a love of music runs throughout the story. I love the idea of kids decades from now now listening to Nirvana, the Smashing Pumpkins, Queen, and Taylor Swift! And bonus points for a mention of contra dancing, which was a big part of my life at one point, and which I'm always happy to see mentioned anywhere. It's thrilling and absorbing - I read it all in one day. And it really packs a punch emotionally, especially since I know that nearly all of the traumas and losses suffered by the characters are based on real things that are already happening as climate breakdown accelerates and governments respond with repression. There are certain moments of the book that will just keep punching me in the gut every time I think of them. If I could change anything about what is otherwise an incredible book, I would add more disability and trans representation. There are multiple queer characters, and hints that one of the main characters is queer, but not a single trans person mentioned across decades of history - which felt unrealistic to me, particularly since so many trans people are involved in social justice movements. There is also some disability rep - one of the main characters has an eating disorder, and multiple characters are injured temporarily or permanently while doing the dangerous work of restoring ecosystems and building infrastructure - but little, if any, mention of people who are disabled in ways that make them unable to do hard physical work. The book never mentions the covid pandemic, and it's unclear whether the story splits off from the real world before or after it - but even without the mass death and disabling event we're currently living through, there would be plenty of people with a wide range of disabilities, and any revolution worth its salt would need to take their needs into account, as well as learn from them about mutual aid, interdependence, meeting conflicting access needs, and dealing with extreme change and uncertainty. There are a few mentions of a Care Corps that provides child care and elder care, and I wish there were a third section that provided care for disabled and chronically ill people who need it. Also, there are a few very brief bits of fatphobia, such as when one teenage character reassures another that the guards walking by are no threat to them because they're old and fat (sigh). It is sadly plausible that fatphobia would persist in a revolutionary future, but I wish the book at least acknowledged it as a bad thing.",2,0
The Great Transition,Shannon (It Starts At Midnight),"1,232","1,070",5,"4.5*Fine, I'll admit it: the first thing about this book that caught my eye was the cover. So sue me. But I am so glad it did, because it was great, and a very ""me"" book! The world has tried to bounce back after climate change brought it to the brink. It's interesting, starting the story after the dramatic bits, the catastrophic bits, went down, and now the world is in the middle of trying to rebuild, to make changes. We meet a family, teenage Emi and her parents Larch and Kristina who are living in a new city in Nuuk Greenland. They seem a lot like a current era family at first look, Emi is having some typical teen struggles with friends and extracurriculars, and Larch and Kristina are seeing quite a bit of degradation in their marriage. When Emi has to interview them (and others) for her school project for the Great Transition, she (and we, the reader) are gifted with their stories of how they contributed to the world getting to where it is today.In the midst of hearing about Emi's project, and seeing how the world has changed, Kristina leaves to volunteer in New York City, which is basically a mess, and she goes AWOL. Meanwhile, the celebration for the Great Transition has been disrupted by an attack by a revolutionary group. Larch becomes quite worried about Kristina, so they head to old America to find her, and hopefully rescue her. But nothing is what it seems at first look, and Larch and Kristina have grown more apart than he even realized.The story alternates between past and present, and we get to see the world as it was when it collapsed, how it was during the collapse, and then the process to rebuild. And of course, we get to see the current society, as well as the problems that are underlying in it, that perhaps the citizens were unaware of, much as we throw ourselves into denial about our current state of affairs. It also focuses a lot on family, and how changes in the family happen. The characters have to do a lot of introspection, and figuring out what they want, and what they want their role in this world to be.It is certainly a quieter book, for the most part, but is certainly character and growth driven.  It is also so thought provoking, because in this book, a lot of people stand up and do their part to help rebuild the world. I simply do not know that people would actually do that in our world, and it certainly makes one think. One thing that was a bit troubling for me was the lack of quotation marks around discussion, it sometimes took me a bit to realize that someone was speaking. I don't know if this is just in the unfinished copy or whether it is just like that, but anyway, that is just a nitpicky thing for me. Oh, and bonus points that the WNBA is a big part of this story! I loved that, because I freaking love seeing women's sports celebrated (in this case, even more so than men's!)
Bottom Line: 
Thought provoking and lovely, The Great Transition focuses on family and rebuilding, and who you want to be in the world you find yourself in.You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight",2,0
The Great Transition,Robin Beard,350,2,4,"The Great Transition is not a book I would typically choose (dystopian climate fiction), but it came highly recommended. And, I am so glad I branched out.

Expected pub date is August 15, 2023.Larch and Kristina are two heroes of the Great Transition with numerous deployments and assignments as they strive towards achieving net-zero emissions for the entire planet. When this is achieved, it is called Day Zero and is marked annually with celebrations. The two marry and have a daughter, Emi.

An interesting perspective with some strong political views told in a creative way.",2,0
The Great Transition,Claire Curtis,168,3,3,3.5Nice world building if a life in a climate changed future. Fairly obvious set up for some ongoing action against remaining climate criminals. An awkward amount of time spent with the protagonist’s inner brain on disordered eating (like a fine topic and all but both tended to the pro-ana talking points and just seemed to be the only way for the author to express her worries). And why doesn’t anyone on the basketball team like her? An enduring mystery.,2,0
Holly,LTJ,154,186,5,"“Holly” by Stephen King is a book I’ve been waiting a very long time to finally read. You see, before “Holly” was officially published on 9/5/23, I went on a Holly-inspired reading marathon so I could jump in and be fully caught up. I’m talking about taking an entire week off of work to enjoy a BOOKcation with everything involving Holly. That’s right ladies and gentlemen, I devoured four novels and an entire short story collection written by King that featured Holly and it was such a rewarding reading experience.Just so you know, to get the most out of “Holly” I highly recommend that you read all five books she is in before reading this novel. The order to read them are…Mr. Mercedes -> Finders Keepers -> End of Watch -> The Outsider -> If It Bleeds -> HollyNow before I jump into my review of this novel, here’s a list of the trigger warnings I found while reading…- Homophobic comments- COVID-19 pandemic- Cannibalism- Politics- Racism- Sexual harassment - Rape- Abortion- Cancer- Alzheimer’s Disease- School shootingsIf any of these trigger you, please don’t read this novel. One more thing I’d like to mention is my thoughts on how tons of readers hated the heavy use of politics, COVID-19, masking, vaxxing, and all that jazz in this novel to the point of being rude and mean to each other due to differences of opinion. As always, reading is subjective and everyone reads for different reasons. Some like the escapism of novels and want to stay away from anything involving world and political events. Others don’t care at all and welcome it for whatever reason. Some will DNF a novel the moment they see things like that because they completely disagree and get all worked up. Others will enjoy it because they agree with that side of the debate.Whatever the case may be, do whatever makes you happy as long as it’s not at the expense of treating others badly. It’s important to remember that if readers completely disagree with King’s views on politics, masking, vaxxing, etc., it’s okay to stop reading and move on to something else. Just please don’t start attacking your fellow Constant Readers because they agree with him on these kinds of topics or vice versa. We’re all readers at heart with different genres and topics we enjoy so no need to attack or be rude to each other over political differences or how people ultimately feel about COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc.In my opinion, King is 75 years old and will be 76 years old on 9/21/23. The fact that he is still writing novels at such a high level is nothing short of incredible. I’m just glad he is because he will forever be my all-time favorite author. Regardless of how you feel about his own political views and opinions on COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc., if you are a horror reader at one point or other in your life he probably gave you at least one character or book you enjoyed based on something he wrote. He’s been writing for over 50 years now and is still going strong.These trigger warnings I mentioned above don’t bother me at all since they’re just words on paper to me. Remember my friends, be kind to each other, no matter where you stand on these political and COVID topics. Whether you agree or disagree, just treat each other with kindness. Trust me, it truly goes a very long way in life.Anywho, I loved this novel so much, and depending on how the rest of this year goes, “Holly” might very well end up being my favorite book of 2023. It was that extraordinary to me and just like the other novels featuring Holly, King did a wonderful job weaving a story within a story within a story with tons of little subtle references here and there. Everything from The Princess Bride, Blood Red Sky (I loved this movie on Netflix), Freddy Krueger, Carrie (lost my mind when he did this), and even The Haunting of Hill House all made me smile. I love it when King does things like this, especially with his own legendary work.The intro to “Holly” was a wild one and my goodness, King dialed up the horror with a very gross twist to things in this one. I made lots of weird faces with those insanely descriptive situations. In general, I was so happy to see Holly get her own novel and not only see what she’s been up to lately but also how she has evolved in the grand scheme of things.To finally get more of Holly’s backstory and fill in the gaps to what makes her tick was such a great thing to read. I have connected with Holly way before this novel came out and reading this solidified to me that she’s a rockstar. I just love the kind of person she is, how vulnerable she can be depending on what is going on at the moment, and just how she figures things out over time.Seeing Holly continuing to be Holly as she pieced things together in this horror mystery novel was a lot of fun. The suspense is all throughout this novel and besides Holly, I also enjoyed how King was able to include Jerome and his sister Barbara to also get updates on them which was nice to read. This is a big reason why I highly recommend reading those five novels I mentioned above since it’ll just make it more meaningful.Besides this incredible unique and disturbing story, King did a phenomenal job breaking down an underlying tone to “Holly” that was evident all throughout this novel. Seeing Holly process grief due to what she’s going through was engrossing. Everyone handles grief differently but to see such a complex and riveting character as Holly goes through this on top of trying to figure out what she’s investigating was nothing short of brilliance.It goes to show that no matter how strong, weird, or complicated someone is on the outside, grief like that affects everyone to some degree even as they vehemently deny it on the inside. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but I just loved seeing Holly turn into the person she is now. Not only am I impressed but well, proud. I know that’ll sound weird but I literally went through a five-novel journey reading them all in a single week and feel like I know Holly. Even King said in recent interviews promoting this novel that there is a bit of Holly in him and well, everyone. I also feel the same as I’ve seen some of my tendencies of handling things as Holly would which makes her so relatable to me.Another thing I loved is how the presence of Bill Hodges so many moons ago impacted Holly so much that it is still helping her in the present. I swear, the quote that King put to open up this novel (“Sometimes the universe throws you a rope.” - Bill Hodges) just hits you from beginning to end. Speaking of which, my goodness, the climax to the ending was fantastic! The main antagonists in this one were pure evil and I loved how Holly handled everything in stride towards that stupendous ending.I was on the edge of my seat getting through that ending because I didn’t think that would ever happen and to see Holly do what she did totally made me scream YES!!! so many times in my head because it was so epic. It was quite the buildup and everything ended perfectly. I loved the ending, actually. Mainly because it ended the way it should have when it comes to Holly and the kind of character she has now become. As always with anything I read by King, I was left mesmerized as Holly is now one of my all-time favorite characters he’s ever created.I give “Holly” by Stephen King a 5/5 as it was so worth reading all five novels Holly was in before this one was published to enjoy watching her evolve into the person she is now. The horror, creepiness, and disturbing aspects of this novel were bloody magnificent. It probably isn’t a good idea to eat or drink anything while reading this one but at the end of it all, Holly rocks. I’m so glad King decided to give this influential character her own novel because this has been quite the reading journey I will never forget for the rest of my life. Finally, the last little thing King left me with besides all this awesomeness involving Holly is that I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again. Ever.","1,098",70
Holly,Debbie Y,30,331,1,"⛧Considering the fact that I enjoyed the vast majority of 𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘨's work, and that he just happens to be one of my favorite authors, I approach this review with frustration, as the highly anticipated 𝐇𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐲 has left me with nothing but a foul taste in my mouth. A week prior to its release, I heard about the controversy surrounding this book and became even more curious about it, so I decided to take a leap and see what it's all about. Reading it felt like opening the fridge at 3 AM while you're parched, just to realize the only offering is a half empty bottle of juice. You're not quite sure how long it's been open, yet your intuition tells you it has been a while. Your curiosity and desire for something cold overcomes your suspicion, so you get it closer to your nose. When your olfactory bulb fails to provide clarity about whether the juice has gone bad, you decide to take a sip and find out. Well, I sipped, I gagged. Here are my conclusions:𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘨 used 𝐇𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐲 as a vehicle to shove his political views down the readers' throat. Mind you, I enjoy the blend of politics in fiction, when it's done with good taste and expands the mind. Most importantly, I respect other people's rights to think and see things differently. However, I was disappointed to find that 𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘨 has failed to do the same by pointing his finger at people who think differently than him. The audacity. The excessive mentions of Covid, vaccines, masks, and the representation of those against it as the root of all evil, made it impossible for me to show a fragment of appreciation towards what could have been a barely mediocre detective thriller, yet ended up being a slow, toothless, formulated, preachy reading experience. The unnecessary, constant mention of Covid has served no purpose whatsoever to the plot of this book. In my opinion, it did the exact opposite. It buried it. Holly's character, who once held a spark which I quite liked in 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘨's previous work, has been assassinated by her very own maker. 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘨 has turned her into an intolerant, judgmental hypochondriac. Certain revelations regarding the villains from the get-go made the plot become even more mind-numbing and oh so predictable. This book exhausted my patience sorely and made me roll my eyes one too many times. It was the first time I ever wanted to abandon a book by 𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘨 before reaching halfway through it, yet I decided to finish it in the hope it would get better. It didn't.""𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐟. 𝐃𝐨𝐞𝐬𝐧'𝐭 𝐢𝐭?... 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐝𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐠𝐞, 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲? 𝐍𝐨.

Holly,Cody | CodysBookshelf,752,261,5,"BREAKING: outspokenly liberal author Stephen King pens a novel about COVID and takes jabs at Trump’s inadequate handling of the crisis. King has NEVER mentioned politics in his books before, and I am outraged! How dare he cover a time period (2020-2021) in which politics was everything and everywhere all at once and actually mention *gasp* Trump by name! Not to mention the vaccines and mandates! (Seriously, the 1-star reviews on Amazon are fucking gold. Since when has politics NOT seeped into King’s fiction? It’s been there since ’Salem’s Lot, at least. I have no love or patience for those “offended moderates” who just want to escape the “real world” into … an art form that often reflects the real world? Because authors are real people living in the real world? The math ain’t mathin’.) And fuck it, I love Holly. The character and the novel. King’s caught some crap lately for his output, especially the crime stuff, and that’s valid. I get why it isn’t for everyone. But I love it, it’s always a fun ass time. I didn’t expect this one to get as dark as it does, sitting very comfortably with one foot in the crime-mystery genre and the other in the horror genre. This book even gave me a few bad dreams, something not all (or even many) of SK’s other releases have done.  I won’t go into specifics because spoilers, but yeah, if you’ve liked Holly’s previous adventures you’ll like this too. Reading the Hodges trilogy, The Outsider, and “If It Bleeds” is necessary. Otherwise you’ll be as lost as I was when I tried reading Insomnia before the Dark Tower series. (That’s a hint at what I’m about to reread with my best friend.)King still has it.

Holly,The Loco Librarian,632,,1,"D.N.F. The first Stephen King book I have ever had to set down.First of all, please know I’m a HUGE fan of King’s books. I have read over half of his published works—love his writing, characters, stories.Holly was my favorite character… I was so excited for this book.However, this book is so chock full of blatant disrespect for people who have certain political views. Now hear me out, I don’t care what your political stance is—but let’s be clear on ONE thing—I will NOT tolerate DISRESPECT. I don’t care what party you classify as or which candidate you voted for—I don’t agree with disrespecting EITHER or ANY side. That is WRONG for ANYONE to do. Honestly man! This is supposed to be work of FICTION for crying out loud—I came here for IMAGINARY characters, events, etc. NOT to relive the VID or deal with political jabs at parties and individuals we disagree with. I am here to ESCAPE reality—not have to hear more hate and disunity.I am so disappointed…Mr. King, with all due respect, learn to RESPECT those you disagree with, that’s our way to unity.—Not hate. Not fighting. Not making fun of others. Not rude comments and jabs.Remember the old saying? —If you don’t have anything nice to say… don’t say anything at all. Be kind. Be better.

Holly,Emily May,"2,031",310k,3,"3 1/2 stars. After some thought, I have decided to round down on this one. I did enjoy it, but compared to King's other work it's definitely not a standout read.Here, King returns to 2021 and the middle of the COVID panic. Holly has OCD and so her approach to the virus-- sanitizing, masks, elbow-bumping --is even more extreme than most others during this period. I guess I'm finally at the point where I don't mind revisiting that shithole of a time, and it was interesting to see how much more paranoid someone with OCD could be. I hadn't considered that before.One thing that will likely determine whether or not readers like this book is how much you care about solving the mystery. Here, there is no mystery to solve for the reader. Right from the start, we are presented with both points of view-- the elderly couple kidnapping and killing (eating) people and Holly, who is investigating the disappearance of a young woman --and so we are bystanders watching this game of cat and mouse, not active participants in the detective work.I actually don't mind this, though. After years of reading mysteries and thrillers, a lot of twists and ""surprises"" fall flat, so I'm usually more interested in the characters and their motivations. I already liked Holly and was interested in her experiences of COVID, as well as her complex grief for her late mother, but I also really enjoyed the villains here. They were batshit, of course, but not without their own batshit reasons, which I found bizarrely convincing.Not King's best, but worth a read if you tolerate ick-factor and characters with very strong political views.",365,3

Holly,Lit with Leigh,556,"3,620",2,"Writing: cozy mystery | Plot: had potential | Ending: salvation!!!!!  SYNOPSIS Holly is back and trying to track down a missing young woman who has most likely been kidnapped by a husband and wife cannibal team.  MY OPINIONS This is my first Stephen King, so by default, my first exposure to Holly. The reviews for this book are VERY opinionated; you either hated it because of the nonstop covid mentions and political rants or you loved it because you're a King stan and he can do no wrong. No shade. I am very much in the first camp, and to save myself from getting attacked I want to make it clear: I do not care that the rona and former president cheeto were mentioned. It is sheer number of times this was mentioned that made this insufferable. Here are the numbers:COVID is mentioned 78 times (every 5.5 pages)Mask is mentioned 63 times (every 7 pages)Trump mentioned 14 times (every 31 pages)Vaxxed mentioned 13 times (every 34 pages) That's all I'm gonna say about the matter so debate your mama. BTW if you come into my comment section condescendingly telling me that this book was written during COVID/trump time I will just block you. Being rude will never change my mind on a topic. Moving on... despite the plot having tons of grisly potential, the book gave me cozy mystery vibes. It didn't creep me out in the slightest, and I'm the type of person that will scream at the top of their lungs if someone walks into a room too loudly. And while I don't mind knowing the who/what/where/why/when of the crime, it was boring as hell watching Holly judge everyone while puffing down a pack a day and going in circles before finally solving the crime. If you go with this type of structure, it needs to be entertaining af. Sadly, it was not. TO ME.However, I definitely want to read another Stephen King. Maybe Carrie? I don't think this is the best representation of his skill level and creativity, so I'm keen to read something that shows what he's really all about. PROS AND CONS Pros: I finally read a Stephen King book! the cover is pretty, the premise had lots of potentialCons: too many mentions of miss rona and politics (see the numbers above), not entertaining, no thrills, too long",219,10
Holly,Stacey's All Booked,226,36,1,"Political trash. I'm so very disappointed. I was really looking forward to another Holly Gibney story. King has really misjudged his audience. I think everyone is sick of Covid by now and no one wants a reminder of the divisiveness in our country, especially in a freaking horror novel. I don't read King for social commentary or his take on current events. I just wanted a creepy supernatural antagonist a la The Outsider. And the same spunky nero-divergent detective protagonist that kicked ass in If It Bleeds. Instead I got serial killing, bigoted, and racist octogenarians, whom one cannot help but think are a substitute for Trump himself, and the new Holly is just sad. This book is poopy.",199,8
Holly,Ginger,827,492,3,"An engaging thriller after all! 3.5 starsHolly was a bit repetitive at times with the Covid details and Stephen King does get more political in this book then others that I've read.He's also writing this during Covid so things were highly charged with politics during those 2+ years.I was okay with the subject matter because as an author, you can write whatever you want.Plus, if you've ever seen his social media, I'm sure you know how he feels. 🤣😂Read Holly or don’t.I feel that as an author, you’re writing for yourself, and King seems to be doing this to a large degree in Holly.As a reader, you can choose to like it or not because you’re reading for you. It’s all subjective anyway in regards to books, art, or movies.
Case in point...
I’m still struggling to understand why my husband didn’t like the movies for The Lord of the Rings but I still love him. I think?! 🧐You can like or love someone and they don’t have to like your favorite movie or book.Don’t take it personal. I see a lot of tribalism on Goodreads and other social media and it turns me off. It's a bit bonkers and seems to squash individuality or thoughts that are different then yours. 
But I digress, let's get back to the book!
I felt that Holly finally gets some momentum at the halfway point and I was enjoying the plot and villains' more.The pacing was off for me in the beginning and dragged more then I was expecting from a Stephen King book.It could have something to do with knowing who the killers are from the beginning?That does tend to take some mystery away from a book.I’m glad I hung in there because the mystery and tension does start coming together and I had a hard time putting this book down from that point on.I enjoyed how Holly puts all the pieces of the puzzle together involving the missing woman. It was engaging to me to see how this character's mind works with OCD and being on the spectrum. That's my guess in regards to those two conditions especially with the daily interactions she does.Plus, I do think she's a hypochondriac and seeing Covid through her eyes was an interesting take. During this time in history, I didn't think about what this pandemic would do to someone who would have a condition like this and I liked the representation of it.Overall, Holly was a good crime thriller to read and had some crazy horror elements thrown in for good measure.
Last thoughts:
I do have some fatigue about Covid along with US politics so I'm sure that played into my rating.I don't go much on Facebook for a reason since I don't care what my Aunt Betty thinks about President Trump and vaccines, and what Uncle Henry thinks about President Biden and Black Lives Matter.It will be curious to see how this will work for me in 10 years when I do a reread.Other then that, I'm looking forward to reading what Stephen King decides to write next!",190,49
Holly,Charlotte May,745,"1,200",4,"I have loved Holly Gibney’s character ever since the Mr Mercedes trilogy. I am so glad that SK loved her just as much to give Holly her own book. I’ve seen a few comments complaining about the Covid element in this book. I think it’s really important to talk about topics relevant to the time the book is set. This has always been the case in Mr Mercedes too. Stephen King writes about the unemployment crisis in America, he has never shied away from the hard topics. When people read this book in later years it will provide information about the years covid was rife. I also believe it strongly fits Holly’s personality - she was always quite extreme when it came to germs etc. When a young woman’s bike is found but with her nowhere to be seen, her mother asks Holly to investigate. What she unravels is terrifying and dangerous. Another thrill ride from Stephen King, I throughly enjoyed it. **********************Yessss to more Holly Gibney!!!!",183,3
Holly,Chantal,567,624,3,"What the frak  was this!?I have a list:📃 Too slow📃 Too much political garbage📃 I don't mind a bit of covid talk, but every chapter had some sort of reference to it📃 All of the above overshadowed the actual storyline.I loved hearing about Holly and how far she has come but I feel the narrator didn't portray her correctly, didn't come across as the Holly we know. If you can get past all of the above the story and plot was great. Loved the added plot of canabalism but its probably not everyone's cup of tea.",172,0
Holly,Helga,"1,055",224,3,"I am a fan of the King and have devoured his previous works like they were the last edible things on earth. I agree with his viewpoint on almost everything. I believe an author is free like any other citizen to voice his opinion and express them in his books. That’s what writing is about, right? But in this book, the King goes against his own golden rules and well…He over-explains and repeats everything. He mentions masks/covid/sanitizer/elbow salute/vaccination and double vaccination so may times, you feel like you are reading a guidebook on how to prevent catching Covid and the terrible consequences if you don't mask/vax. I have been there…I have lived that shit…I have washed my hands millions of times a day, sterilized my belongings, put masks and double masks, vaxxed etc. I don’t want to be reminded of it in a crime/mystery fiction every step of the way. Why would I care if a very minor character whom I will never encounter again is wearing a mask or what does she think about trump or how does she feel about vaccination? Why?I loved Holly’s character in the previous books, but in this one, she annoyed the hell out of me with her “I assume you are vaccinated”, “are you double-vaxxed?” Did you wash your hands how many times? Her elbow-saluting and her judging others. Automatically assuming that the hospitalized people ""obviously"" aren't vaccinated or were against putting masks...""obviously!!""And it is out of character for someone this fussy and obsessed, to chain smoke like a chimney. What do you think the fucking smoke does to your lungs? Caress them?The story itself was of middling quality and knowing the identity of the perpetrators right from the beginning didn’t help either. I have never considered to skip pages of a King, but this one begged for it. I persevered!Sorry for the rant, Mr. King!",166,39
Holly,Peter,"3,094",538,5,"Overshadowed by Covid and Trump, Holly is drawn into her most intriguing case so far. Missing persons. She is book by the mother of the recent missing person, a librarian. Where did she go to? Step by step she is able to establish connections to other missing persons. Who abducted them and why? Stephen King comes up with a very remarkable novel. Evil is old and comes in a form you wouldn't suspect. Is there any serial killer out there? Nail biting crime meets issues we all face everyday: old age and death. Can old age and declining fitness stopped in a way? The master of horror comes up with an outstanding, unusual and extremely compelling novel here. All the ingredients are known, true, the references to Covid and Trump are sometimes as annoying as the items themselves, but to me this definitely is the crime/horror novel of the year. We get deep insight into Holly's personality, his most complicated character so far. This is storytelling on highest level, can't say otherwise. Hope we hear more of Holly in the next years. Highly recommended!",150,6

Holly,Justin,289,"2,383",4,"Full review plus a ranking of every Holly Gibney story now on YouTube! https://youtu.be/0x4-gmw5Jmc?si=63hB_...-Ignore the negative reviews. This is the best Holly story King has written.I received an automated call from my local library on Tuesday, September 5 informing me one of my holds had arrived. I only had one book on hold, and it just so happen to be that book’s release date. Did my library actually get a copy of a brand new book on release day, put my name on it, and call me to come pick it up? They did. That had never happened to me before, so I dropped what I was doing (which was of much, if anything) and rushed to the library. HOLLY was on a shelf right up at the front, waiting for me. I grabbed the book, and a copy of Yellowface since I was mildly interested in that, too, and ran back to my car. I might not have actually ran, but I definitely power-walked. I grabbed the book and power-walked to my car. I spent the past month reading back through the Bill Hodges trilogy, The Outsider, and the If It Bleeds novella. I actually enjoyed most of those stories more on a second read, but I still didn’t have a very high bar set for HOLLY. I thought she was a decent minor character in other books, but I wasn’t sure what else King had in store for her, especially in the spotlight with her own story. Also, I have now learned my issues with Holly is less about her character and much more related to Sill Patton’s impression of her in the audiobooks. It’s just not good at all. I wouldn’t recommend learning about Holly’s backstory that way. Just read the other books with your eyes. Anyway, HOLLY greatly exceeded my expectations. She’s grown tremendously as a character and so has all of the supporting cast around her. Jerome and Brenda are back. Pete’s still kind of around, I guess. But this story is much better than anything from the Hodges trilogy or whatever came after it. All of the issues I had with the other Holly stories are nowhere to be found in this book, and King actually sticks the landing this time. Seriously, halfway through the book I started wondering when it was going to all fall apart. With 50 pages left, I waited for something ridiculous to happen to ruin the whole book. None of that ever happened. The book is fantastic from start to finish. It’s very grounded compared to the other stories Holly appears in, and the villains of this story are completely unexpected… and gross. Alright, so let’s address the elephant in the room. You’re gonna bump into plenty of one-star reviews that talk about how politically charged this thing is and how King’s left wing liberal work agenda blah blah blah. Here’s the thing - the book is set primarily in 2021 with prior events occurring several years prior to that. There’s a lot of COVID stuff, there’s some election stuff, there’s some jabs at Trump, but it never bothered me. It doesn’t distract from the plot, and it helps ground the book in the reality of the time. King definitely has his opinions, and, if you’ve read anything from him recently, you know what those are. Even if you disagree, I don’t think it takes away from the overall story. I actually enjoyed reading a book set during COVID because it reminded me of how crazy things were just a short time ago. Just two years ago, but it feels like much longer than that. It will be interesting to read this again a decade or two from now as a little time capsule of what things were like in 2020-2021. If you can’t get past his politics or don’t want that stuff included in your reading, I guess you could skip this, but you’re missing out. Honestly, the biggest issue isn’t King’s politics, it’s his interpretation of how young adults in 2021 talk to each other. I think he’s stuck in the 1950s when he writes dialogue for younger people. It’s not Stand By Me anymore, man. There’s a scene with a group of kids that felt like it was decades old, and one character says “mondo” at one point. That stuff is much more distracting or pulls you out of the story than anything political injected into this story. That’s my only real complaint here, but it’s fine. Really glad I was able to grab this so quickly from the library. I ripped through it in just a few days, and it was much better than I expected. Now, I should probably be a good little library patron and return it so the next person on the list can read it as soon as possible.",145,22
Holly,Char,"1,740","1,599",5,"As always, the King creates memorable characters.Holly, having just lost her mom to COVID, and having taken up smoking again, (something I recently did myself after my mom's passing last year), she needs to keep her mind occupied. Enter the case of a missing beautiful teen girl, and we are off with Holly as she gets to work. This is King writing crime at his best. Yes, there are horrific elements here and plenty of them, but at heart this is the story of Holly, and I freaking love her. I recommend that you read the Mr. Mercedes crime trilogy and then The Outsider before you read this. So much background will be lost if you don't, and you will never be able to understand just how far Holly has come. You would be cheating yourself of the best part of all these books-Holly's growth. The two villains here are elderly, retired professors. That's why it's so jarring and terrifying to learn about the depth of their crimes. I'm not spoiling anything, but be prepared for a bit of gore and many genuine ewwwwws. I imagine a certain group of folk out there will not like this book and will down vote it or 1 star it, based on their politics. I am rating it based on my heart. I originally gave this 4 stars, but after some mulling I have upped it to 5. Holly has wormed her way deep into my heart and I hope that we haven't seen the last of her.",157,0
Holly,Ruben,62,29,5,"Being a fan of Stephen King's novels, I know he doesn't always include supernatural characters in his stories. Nevertheless, I loved Holly's novel and I can only hope it won't be the last time we hear from her.I haven't read the previous five books of the series, but Holly works perfectly well on its own and now I'm in need of getting to know how she came to being.I loved the story for what it is, and not because of the political or health views it has in it. I think that would be the wrong way of rating this novel.Holly is a private investigator who's recently lost her mother to Covid, and although she's really far from properly grieving over her, she receives a call from Penny Dahl, a woman whose daughter recently went missing, and who can only hope for Holly's willingness to take the case to help her find out what happened to her.Although a bit reluctantly, Holly takes the case only to find out that Bonnie's (Penny's daughter) disappearance may be linked to some other disappearances that somehow lead all to the Harris (Rodney and Emily). Why and how would they be linked to all this? Holly isn't sure, but her curiosity and her investigative skills might help her unveil some facts that she may later regret knowing.As usual, it seems that the only possible way to find out is by getting immersed into Holly's world.This is perhaps (in my view) one of the best books I've read this year.",145,8
Holly,Liz,"2,260","3,046",4,"Holly is the sixth in the Holly Gibney series. I read the first and none in between. So, it’s safe to say it works fine as a stand-alone.The story takes place in 2021, smack dab in the middle of Covid. In fact, Holly’s partner, Pete, is recovering even though he was vaxxed. And her mother has died of Covid, having refused to get the vaccine. Holly is hired to find a young woman that has gone missing and the police don’t have time or resources to devote any attention to her case. As Holly investigates, it starts to look like others have gone missing and may be somehow related. And, as odd as it seems, the evidence points to an octogenarian couple of retired professors. With the cold weather here and the arthritis in my fingers starting to really give me fits, I’m almost tempted to see if Rodney and Em’s fix would work. (Just kidding.) King has the ability to create some of the creepiest bad guys and this couple is no exception. This is the antithesis of a cozy mystery and there were numerous times that I was grossed out. Holly is a fascinating main character. She’s come a long way since Mr. Mercedes and I really want to go back and see her transformation. She’s strong and resourceful. I do wish she’d quit smoking. (See, she’s that real that I want what’s best for her health.) She’s dealing with some really weird sh** that she discovers after her mom’s passing. The book moves quickly and I was engaged throughout. I listened to this 15 hour book in three days. It was that entertaining. Anyone who doesn’t want to read about Covid needs to steer clear of this book. Likewise,Trump fans should avoid this as King makes no secret of his political stand. He’s also a big believer in vaccines and the whole “are you vaccinated?” plays out front and center throughout the story. King has a big presence on X (formerly Twitter), so his political beliefs shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. I listened to this and was impressed by Justine Lupe’s narration.This has motivated me to go back and read the earlier books.",120,18
Holly,Karen,"1,756",371,4,"Okay. Let me just explain two things. One. Stephen King scares me. So, I have not been a particular fan of his, which means I have not read his books. I know. It started as a youngster when I saw a couple of movies that were based on his novels. That did me in. So, anytime his books came out, I just stayed clear. Until now. So…What changed?This one. But…I know I am in trouble. Because…I am coming in with the 6th book in the series. My second thing to discuss.So…Two.This may have put me at a disadvantage. Although, in reading the synopsis, prior to making the decision to read the book, it assured me, that Holly was on her own for the first time. Which…Made me feel, that maybe Holly and I could be comfortable in this circumstance. Let’s see if it worked.It begins with Holly Gibney, a private investigator, our main protagonist, (Hence: the title of the book), attending her mother’s funeral. When…She is approached by a woman asking for her help to find her missing daughter. And…Thus, the story goes. Into…Darkness. A lot of darkness. Apparently, the missing young woman vanished from Red Bank Avenue, a derelict strip of self-storage units, warehouses and empty lots. Up the hill from the avenue, the retired professors Emily and Rodney Harris live in a row of expensive Victorian houses.Now…The Harrises are considered respected members of the college community. But…What really goes on in their basement?And…This is why I haven’t read a Stephen King novel before. Can I just say the crimes described felt a bit queasily believable?Perhaps that should be considered a compliment to this writer. But…Even though this book does have a high body count, please note…Most of the deaths through these pages aren’t caused by its villains – they are from Covid. Holly’s investigation begins in July, 2021, as hospitals are piling up with patients and temporary morgues. And…In this regard, even Holly shares…“When this is over, no one will believe it really happened. Or if they do, they won’t understand how it happened.” Still…The evil within the characters is on full display... And…It is obvious that King is bending the rules of a police procedural, by revealing the perpetrators’ identities in the opening chapter. But…As readers knowing this early, gives the narrative more urgency, especially as the gruesome nature of their crimes becomes more obvious. As an author he knows how to point the difference between right and wrong – and evil. The question to readers is what toll does it create? After staring directly at the worst sorts of evil a human can commit… Do we come away stronger? Or just very, very sad? To be honest, I had nightmares at least two nights in a row. And…I know it was from reading this book. So…This book is my one and done.",117,11

""A veces el universo te echa un cable"" (Bill Hodges)
He disfrutado mucho con esta lectura. No es el mejor noir que ha escrito King, pero ya quisieran muchos otros de los que he leído este año llegarle a la altura.Dice la sinopsis:La nueva novela del Rey del Terror recuerda a joyas como Misery y cuenta con un personaje muy querido por sus lectores, Holly Gibney, la detective privada que, por primera vez, protagoniza una novela en solitario. Cuando Penny Dahl contacta con Finders Keepers para que la ayuden a encontrar a su hija, algo en la voz desesperada de la mujer hace que Holly Gibney se vea obligada a aceptar el trabajo. A poca distancia del lugar en el que Bonnie Dahl desapareció, viven los profesores Rodney y Emily Harris. Son la quintaesencia de la respetabilidad un matrimonio octogenario y dedicado de académicos semiretirados. Nadie diría que, en el sótano de su impecable casa forrada de libros, esconden un secreto directamente relacionado con la desaparición de Bonnie. Son astutos, pacientes y despiadados, y obligarán a Holly a emplear sus habilidades al máximo y a arriesgarlo todo si quiere cerrar el caso más oscuro al que se ha enfrentado jamás. Mis impresiones.King nos ofrece en esta novela un buen noir, construido, con la minuciosidad que le caracteriza. Como es habitual en él, crea y recrea atmósferas e integra lo cotidiano. El ritmo, aunque con la marca de la casa, es más ágil de lo que el maestro acostumbra. Es notable como en una novela en la que, desde el principio, sabemos quiénes son los asesinos, King vaya aumentando la intriga en cada capítulo. Tras un comienzo impactante, la tensión se mantiene. Me enganchó desde el principio y el enganche fue a más a medida que avanzaba. La manera en que Holly descubre poco a poco todo el lío es lo que mantiene la tensión.Desarrolla una trama principal, la de las desapariciones, y dos subtramas, una, relativa a la vida personal de Holly, bien integrada, y otra, a la incipiente carrera de Bárbara como poeta, que no tanto. Cronológicamente se sitúa en julio del 2021, cuando la variante delta del covid hacía estragos entre la población, atmósfera, que el autor recrea de forma magistral. La investigación de las desapariciones está bien llevada. Es cierto que el universo le echa un cable a Holly de vez en cuando, pero son cables bien trabajados y mejor presentados al lector, de esos que no chirrían. Los personajes son magníficos, tanto los conocidos como los nuevos. King le da otra vuelta de tuerca a Holly, un grandísimo personaje que sigue evolucionando. Junto a ella volvemos a encontrarnos a Pete y Jerome (con menos presencia de la que hubiese querido), y a Bárbara, con subtrama propia de la que luego hablaré. Entre los nuevos, los Harris, la pareja de villanos en tonos de gris.Tremendos ambos y lo que hacen, pero qué relación tan entrañable la que tienen como matrimonio de cuarenta años juntos, y qué bien lo plasma el maestro. Resaltar el amplio bagaje cultural de King, que vuelve a poner en juego en esta obra. Sus alusiones a la literatura, son las de alguien que ha empleado y emplea muchas horas de su tiempo en la lectura. Desde Cormac MacCarthy hasta Shakespeare, pasando por otros muchos autores. Que todavía haya quién dude de que este hombre posee cultura para dar y tomar es algo que no consigo explicarme.El final es bueno, fluye bien, es coherente y deja todo cerrado.¿Y los peros?La subtrama protagonizada por Bárbara me ha parecido metida con calzador. En sí misma todo lo que nos cuenta es interesante, pero su relación con la trama principal es tangencial y las pistas que proporciona las más discutibles.Me ha gustado mucho Holly, pero es un personaje con un toque que funciona mejor cuando tiene un contrapunto. Esta novela la protagoniza en solitario y toque y contrapunto se echan de menos.Tampoco descarto que sea un pero subjetivo (los personajes evolucionan), la nostalgia por Bill Hodges, o que me haya faltado más presencia de Jerome. Como buena novela negra y como todas las de King, contiene mucha crítica político social. Lo que expone es real y lo subscribo, pero es demasiado reiterativo, se le ha ido un poco la mano.No quiero terminar esta reseña sin señalar la profesionalidad de King, escritor prolífico donde los haya, que, como debe de ser, está al tanto de la cronología que establece en sus obras y su encuadre en la realidad. ""Holly"" se sitúa después de ""La sangre manda"". Entre ambas, una laguna ajena a la voluntad del autor de la que él mismo nos cuenta que está ahí y es consciente de ello. Igualito que otros escritores a los que he leído este año, que o bien sacrifican en el altar del ritmo frenético la cronología de sus obras o bien ni son conscientes de ella. En conclusión. Un noir de la factoría King con el que he disfrutado mucho. No es tan bueno como la trilogía de Mr. Mercedes, pero sí recomendable.",105,4
Holly,Marie,999,328,5,"Crime Mixed With Horror!Small backstory:Holly Gibney is on the trail of a kidnapped girl named Bonnie. Her mother Penny Dahl pleads with Holly to take the case of finding her daughter as she just wants her daughter found safe and sound as the police seem to be doing nothing to look for her daughter so Holly finally decides to take the case. Holly slowly works her way through with tracking down leads which almost takes her down a rabbit hole as she pulls in some resources and friends to help her out as she tries to find out what happened to Bonnie but as time goes on the mystery deepens as she finds out there have been more disappearances in the same area. What Holly soon realizes is someone is doing something within the town and she has a feeling that all the disappearances are tied together, but finding the link is going to take some work and she hopes to find Bonnie alive before it is too late! That is about all I can give on a small backstory so if you want to know more then go read this book!Thoughts:The core of this story was exceptionally good - I love the horror that was weaved into the crime aspects of the story as King just slowly added horror bits to the story lacing it with his special touch. The suspense and build up of what was happening took a little time to get going almost like a slow burn but there were so many other things to focus on as the story gained speed. King dropped a few Easter eggs within the story with connections to some of his books which was cool. He name dropped some movies that I have seen along with name dropping an author I have read. Just different things like that which were slowly added to the story which was almost like adding seasonal herbs to a dinner with a dash of wine! Now onto some other thoughts with this book and I am not dragging the book or the author threw the pits of hell or over hot coals as I have seen some reviews so far for this book that does just that so all I am going to say is this on that subject matter. This book was set during the time of the pandemic and yes there is quite a bit of everything that took place during that time in this book but truly this book would be considered ""historical fiction"" as that is basically what is laid out in here. There are lots of fiction books out there set in times of historical upheaval whether it be wars or conflicts throughout a country or countries and this book is no different. Yes for some people it is hard to read about but it did happen - history has already been set - no one can go back in time to change the past. I watched an interview with King about this book and he said that the book is like a time capsule meaning for future generations that read the book they will know about what happened during the time of the pandemic. So after laying out my thoughts on all that with the pandemic - this story was classic King - he takes the reader deep into a crime/mystery story with the character Holly who has some detective skills that she hones as the story progresses. The puzzle pieces start really interlocking past the 50% mark of the book and the book goes into overdrive past the 70% mark as things become known within the storyline. All in all it was a great story with all the crime and horror weaved together that kept me glued to my seat as the more the pace picked up the less I wanted to put it down! This is why King is the Master of Horror! He knows how to take you places that you don't want to go and drops you into a viper pit for no way out - well maybe he will throw down a rope! :) Giving this book five ""Terror Thriller"" stars!Noted statement for this review as I know this book is a hotbed with diverse opinions so I am adding this statement to my review.  Golden Rule: If you have nothing nice to say do not say anything at all.",106,22
Holly,Will Byrnes,"1,321",121k,4,"I had to write this book to write one scene, which I saw clearly in my mind. Holly attending her mother’s zoom funeral. I didn’t have a story to go with it, which was unfortunate, but I kept my feelers out because I loved Holly from the first and wanted to be with her again. Then one day I read a newspaper story about an honor killing. I didn’t think that could be my story, but I loved the headline, which was something like this: everyone thought they were a sweet old couple until the bodies began turning up in the backyard. Killer old folks, I thought. That’s my story. - from Author’s NoteHolly Gibney, partner in the Finders Keepers Detective Agency she inherited from Bill Hodges, (of the Bill Hodges trilogy, in which Holly first appeared) is called in by a distraught mother, Penny Dahl. Her daughter, Bonnie, has been missing for three weeks, and the police are at the point of washing their hands of the case. A peculiar, ambiguous note had been found on her bicycle. But there was no helmet found. Curious, no? Stephen King - image from New Hampshire Magazine – illustrated by John R. GoodwinHolly is on her own, as her partner is laid up with COVID. She has just attended her mother’s funeral. So Holly is emotionally laid low. People close to her have urged her to take some time to grieve. Still, a case might be a way to keep moving, so the game is afoot. It is not long before another missing person case shows up in her research, and another. Tough to prove, but Holly suspects there is a serial killer at work. The book opens with
It's an old city, and no longer in very good shape, nor is the lake beside which it has been built, but there are parts of it that are still pretty nice. Longtime residents would probably agree that the nicest section is Sugar Heights, and the nicest street running through it is Ridge Road, which makes a gentle downhill curve from Bell College of Arts and Sciences to Deerfield Park, two miles below. On its way, Ridge Road passes many fine houses, some of which belong to college faculty and some to the city's more successful businesspeople—doctors, lawyers, bankers, and top-of-the-pyramid business executives. Most of these homes are Victorians, with impeccable paintjobs, bow windows, and lots of gingerbread trim.
Hmmm, maybe King was not quite done with thought processes from his novel, Fairy Tale. One of those Victorians is home to a couple of octogenarians, mostly-retired professors at the nearby Bell University. They seem ok to a brief glance, but spend time with either one and you might feel the urge to pop up and say, “check please.” Both are considered, at the very least, odd, by those who know them. Some find them creepy. They are far worse.Holly is assisted in her investigation by two associates from prior cases. Jerome and Barbara Robinson are both game to help, but both have other things going on, so are not entirely available. This is a crucial element in sustaining tension, (along with hoping Holly can figure out what is going on in time to save Bonnie) as their disconnection from Holly keeps her from figuring everything out much sooner. What happens if you have, among the team, all the pieces to the puzzle but simply cannot get them all on the table at the same time? The story proceeds as, um, a procedural. Discover this clue, follow it, find another clue, follow that, and so on. Keep the unconnected breadcrumbs floating about in one’s consciousness until it becomes clear where they lead. There is nothing paranormal going on in this one, although abnormal would certainly fit.Two time-lines swap back and forth. In the present, July 2021, Holly pursues her investigation. In the other we flash back to each of the victims, who they were, how they were taken, and how they were treated once captured. King wrote this book during the height of the COVID pandemic, and wanted to make that a major part of the novel. We encounter Holly when she is disconnecting from her mother’s funeral. She, and others, had attended via Zoom. Mom was a diehard, literally, anti-vaxer. Buh-bye. And from what Holly expresses about the dearly departed, she is not all that sad to see her go. Throughout the story, Holly has to decide, mask-or-no-mask, for every interview. Shake hands or bump elbows? She is maybe OCD, or even somewhere on the autism spectrum, but she certainly has an enhanced intuition that some think might be a form of the shining made famous in the book by that name. Maybe she is just a really gifted detective? There is no overt diagnosing of Holly’s abilities or limitations in the book. In addition to the presence of COVID, King offers looks at a range of people and their political attitudes. A bowling alley manager is a full-on conspiracy theorist. Emily Harris’s diverse bigotries are baked in. Speaking of bigotries, one that 76-year-old King addresses is ageism. It usually manifests in presuming the elderly to be incapable of or disinterested in this or that based simply on their age. This is a bit of bias that Holly shares, to her own peril. 
I know that there are a lot of people out there on X, or whatever you want to call it, that are convinced that Covid is over and it’s not a going concern anymore. What do you think of that idea?Well, Holly’s mother is a Covid denier, and she dies in the hospital of Covid. And to the very end, she’s saying, “I’ve just got the flu. The flu is what I have.” And I think that it goes back to this is not a new thing. There have been people for years who have just been vaccination deniers who say that if you get a vaccination for a certain kind of thing, you’re going to cause birth defects in your children, this and that. Or if you vaccinate your children, they could have strokes. And you see the same things about the Covid vaccinations. There’s this constant story that thousands of people are dying of heart disease because of the vaccinations. It’s not true, but it’s gained a lot of credence. So there’s a lot of that. And I tried to put that in the book. There are characters in the book who just say, “I don’t believe in this bullshit. It’s all crap.” And that’s the life that we live. And I always try to reflect the time that I’m writing in. – from the Rollingstone interviewIt is easy to root for Holly Gibney as she struggles to learn the truth. This keeps us interested in the book. King is right to keep going back to her. (this is the sixth time) She is sooooo engaging. But there is another course in this meal. King points out how holding false beliefs can lead to mayhem, even death. It certainly did for Holly’s mom, and there is at least one criminal motivation in here that is based on a non-COVID-related disproven theory. This may not be to everyone’s taste. “I’ve had enough” was the note left on Bonnie Dahl’s bicycle. But I bet that by the time you finish reading Holly you will be hungry for a second helping. 
The outsider masquerading as Terri Maitland was evil. So was the one masquerading as Chet Ondowsky. The same was true of Brady Hartsfield, who found a way to go on doing dirt (Bill’s phrase) even after he should have been rendered harmless. Rendered that way by Holly herself. But Roddy and Emily Harris were worse.

Holly,Mikki,30,14,1,DNF at 7%. You’d think I would learn by now. More politics and constant Covid talk. Nah. I lived through 2020 and Trump and I did just fine. Don’t need the rehashing or bashing.,94,0
Holly,Nilufer Ozmekik,"2,466",50k,5,"Oh, buckle up for the triumphant return of Holly Gibney, Stephen King's ingenious detective, in this chilling novel that dives deep into a midwestern town's sinister secrets.In ""Holly,"" King weaves a masterful tale, throwing readers headfirst into a horror-laden journey. The suspense is palpable, the twists are stomach-churning, and my goodness, did he amp up the horror with some seriously gross twists. But let's talk about Holly. Finally, our beloved recluse turned detective gets her own spotlight, and it's a wild ride. King peels back the layers of Holly's character, delving into her backstory and evolution, and it's an absolute joy to witness. Holly, with her vulnerabilities and uncanny ability to piece things together, shines as the star of this horror mystery. The suspense keeps you on the edge, and the inclusion of familiar faces like Jerome and Barbara adds a layer of depth that fans will appreciate. King's storytelling prowess doesn't just stop at crafting a unique and disturbing narrative; he brilliantly delves into an underlying theme — grief. Watching Holly grapple with her emotions while navigating a twisted investigation is nothing short of brilliance.And let's not forget the impact of Bill Hodges. The quote that kicks off the novel The climax to the ending is nothing short of fantastic, with pure evil antagonists and Holly's epic handling of the situation. I was on the edge of my seat, screaming ""YES!!!"" in my head. The ending is spot-on, reflecting the growth and strength of Holly's character. Now, for the naysayers bringing politics into the mix—come on! King has always infused his fiction with real-world elements, and ""Holly"" is no exception. As for me, I love Holly, the character, and the novel. King effortlessly straddles the crime-mystery and horror genres, delivering a dark narrative that even invaded my dreams. If you've enjoyed Holly's previous adventures, this one's a must-read. And here's a gentle reminder to heed the trigger warnings: homophobic comments, the COVID-19 pandemic, politics, racism, rape, abortion, Alzheimer’s Disease, school shootings etc. Holly's journey, post her mom's COVID-related demise, is gripping, and King excels at writing crime at its best. For the full experience, dive into the Mr. Mercedes trilogy and ""The Outsider"" before embarking on this enthralling journey. The villains may be elderly professors, but the depth of their crimes will leave you horrified and saying plenty of genuine ""ewwwwws."" Holly has nestled her way deep into my heart, and I'm crossing my fingers that this isn't the last we've seen of her. In the realm of King's new releases, this one is a winner.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter",103,0
Holly,Roberta Higginbottom,,3,1,"Book is awful with very little story. It mostly spews Kings views on Politics, Covid, climate change and racism. I care nothing for the views of a wealthy and spoiled man on these subjects.",85,8
Holly,Twerking To Beethoven,400,82,1,"Thank you GR for removing my review because some butthurt fanboy flagged it. Anyways, I still think ""Holly"" sucks arse. Am I going to elaborate? No, but I think it's shite.",86,21
Holly,Jenna ❤ ❀  ❤,846,"1,481",4,"Occasionally someone comments on reviews to let me know it would have been a great! review had I not included politics. They go on to inform me that politics has no place in fiction, and I ruined my review by inserting politics.To those people: 1. You mistake me for someone who cares that a complete stranger who has their head in the clouds doesn't like my review.2. Have you never read Tolstoy, Hugo, Dickens, Dostoyevsky or other many, many classic writers? Dante with his Inferno full of politicians?3. Don't bother with Stephen King's Holly because you'll get butt-hurt, especially if you're a trumper and anti-vaxxer. To everyone else, dive right in!I didn't realize that Holly Gibney (Jibba Jibba) appeared in 5 previous novels. I no doubt missed some references, and didn't know who a couple mentioned characters were because of that. I still enjoyed it and don't think it is necessary to have read those other novels before this one. I'm ambivalent about Holly's character. She didn't make me feel anything. I should have, especially since she's a hypochondriac like me who wore latex gloves and N95 masks even after getting vaccinated (I only ceded those things this summer and still don an N95 at the doctor's).I don't know what it was about Holly, she was a bit of a bore. She also annoyed me with her use of ""fracking"". Just say ""fucking"" already. Remember Annie Wilkes in Misery with her dirty birdies and cockadoodies. That was some entertaining non-swearing Annie Wilkes delivered. Holly and her fracking though, that just made my eyes roll.At one point she let loose with ""fucking"" and I had hope for her. It didn't last long.I loved reading every other character's POV except hers. The story comes together through several characters. My favorites were young Barbara the aspiring poet and her mentor Olivia, and those geriatric, creepo professors emerti.Those two were bonkers. Sadistic and crazy both. Talk about believing shit without proof... Old Professor Harris was a pro at that. I was simultaneously amused and appalled by them. I don't want to say too much and give anything away, though the truth about them is apparent early on. It's no secret Stephen King dislikes trump and he makes that clear in this novel as well. There's also quite a bit about Covid, mask-wearing, vaccinations, anti-vaxxers, BLM, police brutality, racism, and -is this really a thing?- elbow bumps.To those who are turned off by this, King writes in the afterword, ""I think fiction is most believable when it coexists with real-world events, real-world individuals"". I agree. This is a fun read in spite of the seriousness. There's some gore. I don't think I'll ever want a strawberry parfait again.",82,38
Holly,Debra,"2,580",35.6k,3,"""I could never let Holly Gibney go. She was supposed to be a walk-on character in Mr. Mercedes, and she just stole the book and stole my heart. Holly is all her."" - Stephen KingI could not wait to get my hands and eyes on this book. I wanted more Holly and was curious to read a book with her without Bill Hodges in it. Having read the above quote from Stephen King, which is on the back of the book, I knew this was his love letter to her. If any constant readers follow King on social media, you know he is not shy about voicing his politics. Nor was he shy about sharing them in this book. Holly was written during the pandemic and there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of COVID and political talk/opinions in this book. Will it be too soon for some readers? Perhaps, but keep in mind that Holly takes place during COVID. His characters will be wearing masks (or not), washing their hands, not shaking hands, talking about vaccination, etc. Plus, this is King's book, so he is free to write and have his character's feel and express whatever he pleases. I have no problem whatsoever with his viewpoints, but eventually I began to wonder if it was just too much. For the first half of the book, I struggled with getting into the story. It felt slow and honestly, it didn't grab my attention as his other books have. There are some ""bad"" characters in this book doing some bad things, but I wasn’t creeped out by them as I usually am by King's villains. I felt very meh about them. They were not that interesting in my opinion. Peculiar, twisted, bizarre, yes but also bland and I'll say it again meh. What was not meh, was Holly and her approach to solving a case and how she looked at things. The second half of the book, and especially that last third of the book, moved much faster and I was finally invested in the plot. The latter part of the book is also when King cooled off on the political and COVID talk and got to the business of Holly doing detective work. The book began to feel tense and there was a sense of danger at the end which I always enjoy in books in this genre. I so wanted to love this book as I have enjoyed Holly as a character. For me, this was enjoyable but way too slow. I struggle with slow books. Plus, I was hoping to be creeped out. Readers know who the depraved characters are, so we are watching and waiting for Holly to solve her case. King has always written interesting, unique, and engaging characters. No matter how I feel about them, I am usually intrigued and captivated by them. In this book, as I mentioned, Holly was the only one who I felt one way or another about. The other characters just didn't stand out for me until the end. For me, not his best. This won’t stop me from being on the lookout for his future books. King is well, the King of horror in my book. He knows how to spin a yarn. We can't love them all, even books we are highly anticipating. Many are loving this book more than I did, so please read their reviews as well.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com",95,22
Holly,the good american reader,11,3,1,"This book is a very clear indication of Stephen King's personal political bias. The book is so clearly anti-republican that it damages the storytelling. To think that this came from the same author that wrote Salem's Lot, It, The Green Mile, Pet Semetary, The Perfect Storm and more is flabbergasting! This book makes a very conscious effort to attack Republicans and Trump (by name) frequently. I'm 54 tracks into the audiobook and I'm hoping that the story gets good enough to justify listening to all the political berating. So far, it's not fulfilling that hope. I'm glad that I used an audiobook subscription credit for this instead of paying for it.",76,0
Holly,,,,4,"A folksy King novel significantly focused on Holly's interactions with the Covid pandemic. While on the case she encounters pro-vax and anti-vaxxers. There's also references to the Jan. 6 insurrection, BLM protests, elbow bumps, Zoom funerals and even murder hornets. I didn't find the social commentary too preachy, though it did sometimes read more like Stephen King on Twitter than Holly Gibney the character.Beyond that there's crazy cannibals on the loose. These villains are memorably creepy, for sure, even if a little cartoonish. An author's note at the end has to clarify that eating human organs does not have anti-aging health benefits. I would say it's insulting for King to think his readers are that dumb, but goodness knows anything can be a TikTok challenge these days.Unlike many King novels, but in line with the Mr. Mercedes-related series, the ending is quite good. The finale is dramatic as ever, gory, and emotional. I don't know if this is the last of Holly (King seems to refuse to let her go) but it would also serve as a very satisfying conclusion to the series as a whole.Looking back, it's strange that I'm among the disappointed whenever King announces a new Holly-related book. The Mr. Mercedes trilogy is fantastic, among his best work post-Y2K. The Outsider is wonderful, and If It Bleeds is a nice little adventure as well. Holly is perhaps near the bottom of the list, but still a lovely novel that feels cozy because of King's folksy prose. I've come to very much enjoy following her on a case. Even when there's no real mystery to solve. We know right away who the cannibals are, but watching Holly get closer and closer to unspeakable horror remains a winning formula for me.",74,3
How to Sell a Haunted House,megs_bookrack,"1,727",11.8k,5,"I can't recall when Grady Hendrix and I had a conversation about everything I would love to see in a Horror novel, but the man must have been taking notes!!!This story follows Louise Joyner and her brother, Mark. Louise lives in California, while her brother, Mark, still lives in their hometown of Charleston, South Carolina.The two siblings are not close. They basically only see each other, or talk really, when they are doing things with the rest of the family, like with their Mom, Dad, cousins, Aunts, etc. Otherwise, it's a bit like cats and dogs.So, when Louise receives a random call from Mark, she knows the news can't be good and it's not. It's like the rug has been ripped out from under her.Their parents were killed in an accident. Louise needs to come home right away. It's devastating. She leaves her 5-year old daughter, Poppy, with her ex, packs her things and boards a plane.There's so much to do, the funeral, the estate, but she doesn't want to be dealing with any of it. She just wants to be alone, but unfortunately, when people die they leave things behind that have to be dealt with.Her parents left a lot behind. Of course they did, they weren't expecting to go anytime soon. They built an entire life in Charleston. They lived in the same house that Louise and Mark's Mom grew-up in; decades and decades of stuff, memories, accumulating. How can they get rid of all of that? Stressful! Adding fuel to the fire, there are unexpected turns, mainly involving the wills, that leave Louise and Mark even more at odds.This sounds like a lot, doesn't it? It is. It is for regular people with regular items that need to be dealt with, but what is kept within the walls of Louise and Mark's childhood home isn't exactly what you would call regular.Their Mom was a puppeteer. She hand-made all of her own puppets; hundreds and hundreds of puppets. But even puppets need more friends, so there are dolls and odd taxidermy craft projects as well. Every room seems to have dozens of little eyes watching your every move.From the moment Louise sets foot in the house, she feels like something is off. It's giving her the creeps, she can hardly stand to be in there anymore. Memories overwhelm her. Disturbing incidents from her childhood. Was it just her imagination? Is it now?Regardless of the vibe of the house, her and Mark want to prep it for sale. Both of them need the money. They need this done quick. They'll have to work together.I won't say anything more about the plot of this novel, as I definitely recommend going into it knowing as little as possible. I didn't really know what it involved when I started and I'm so glad. I knew Haunted House, siblings and the fact that their parents had passed away. From that I expected to really enjoy this as I love Horror that explores grief, complicated family dynamics and of course, haunted houses.This story does have all of that, but also much more. The surface level story is so engaging, yet this one runs deep. If you want to unpack it all, there's a lot to explore.Louise and Mark. Their relationship is so complicated. At first, I hated Mark. Not going to lie. I thought he was the biggest jerk to his sister and for no reason. He seemed spoiled to me and jealous of her.As the story builds, you do get back story of their childhood and a lot of interesting things had happened to them; between them. I felt like after reading that stuff, Mark's personality started to make a lot more sense.I loved watching the evolution of their relationship as well. As they began to open up with one another and tried to understand the other's perspective. I thought that was such a nicely done progression. I felt bad that it took the death of their parents for them to have those needed conversations.It was dramatic. I also started to feel a certain way towards their parents and it wasn't very charitable. I felt like they had sort of plagued their own children to grow up with certain issues because of the choices they had made.This won't make sense until you read the novel, but just trust, if you become as invested in this as I did, your emotions will run the full range before you are done. With emotional range in mind, I loved the clever section titles. Well played by Hendrix.I can acknowledge that this book won't be for everyone. I know that. It plays on certain tropes not everyone is going to love, but for me, this was a top-tier Horror story. It was incredibly well-told with compelling characters, deep family issues and themes explored, as well as toe-curling imagery. This played off all of my childhood fears and let's be frank, things I am still afraid of today, even as an adult.I had moments where I had to walk away from it. It was scary to me. Seriously, there were nights when I had to put it down and read a palate cleansing book before I could even attempt to go to sleep. That's a sign of a great story!Thank you so much to the publisher, Berkley, for providing me with a copy to read and review.This was absolutely one of my most anticipated books of the year and it did not disappoint. In fact, I've found a new one to add to my 'Favorites' shelf!!",935,3
How to Sell a Haunted House,Nilufer Ozmekik,"2,466",50k,5,"Annabelle meets Child’s Play in a dysfunctional family drama that includes unresolved sibling problems and a perfect dark sense of humor. I can honestly say that this is the tensest, most nerve-bending, creepiest horror/dark comedy story I've read lately! I chuckled a lot and mostly gave my loudest hysterical laughs, especially during the last third of the book when things got out of control and escalated to a new level of batshit craziness! You tell yourself ""no freaking way it can happen,"" but eventually things happen beyond your imagination, and so many jaw-dropping, shocking moments later, you let out your screams so loud! (I don’t recommend you read this book in public places to avoid getting too much unnecessary attention.) The squirrel nativity attacks, avenging scary dolls popping out their eyes, and a very dangerous puppet trying to possess you! Yes! So many unbelievably scary things happen in this book, and if you like the haunted house theme, buckle up and enjoy the fun from the front seat.Louise is a single mother, 39, living in San Francisco, focusing on her career and her little girl Poppy. She is estranged from her parents and her troublesome brother Mark. One night, Mark calls her and informs her that their parents died in a car accident, and he waited for nearly two days to mention it! Reluctantly, Louise flies to Charleston to go to her childhood house she left years ago, which is filled with the weirdest Annabelle-style dolls and hundreds of puppets her mother made and literally gave life by attending Christian puppet ministry, giving performances with her puppets at churches for years. Let's not forget the lots of taxidermies shelved among the puppets. Louise wants to get rid of everything, go back to her life in San Francisco, hug her daughter, and forget everything else about her house. But her brother keeps pushing her buttons. If the house is sold, she may get rid of financial problems, and she finds herself fighting with her brother for the inheritance. Finally, she gives up, but even though she plans to run away again, the house has no intention of letting her go.Louise and Mark realize that there's something truly threatening about the place, and it's more than just bad energy, a powerful curse, or something scary. There's something very dangerous giving life to vengeful puppets and avenging squirrels. There's something in their house that's so angry, and it has no intention of going anywhere without taking more lives! This book is heart-throbbing and so scary! In the middle of the book, I screamed so much and hid in a closet, imagining that I was being chased by puppets! After I gathered my courage, I pushed myself to wear big girl's pants and an adult diaper to read the rest of it!I adored Louise and Mark's sibling relationship dynamics and how their unreliable perspectives affected their lives. Both of their memories are so subjective, and we realize that nothing is as it seems. Both of them are flawed characters who learn to give themselves second chances!I think I'll have Pupkin-full nightmares for months, but it's truly worth it! If you're okay with family drama and the scariest haunted dollhouse theme, this book is a perfect match for your needs! I'm giving it 5 puppet masters! (It's impossible to give a Grady Hendrix work less than five stars.)Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology: medium bloginstagramfacebook twitter",601,0
How to Sell a Haunted House,MarilynW,"1,318","3,403",3,"How to Sell a Haunted House by Grady HendrixI've never watched one of those haunted doll or haunted puppet movies or one of those teen slashers. I've not watched any horror movies except that spinning head one and wished I hadn't watched that one. But I did enjoy two of Grady's books, kind of, sort of, skipping over grossness when it appeared. So I decided to give this story a try but I'm just too far off the fan base to feel invested. I do like some haunted house stories but this is something else. Louise is living across the country from her childhood home, her parents and her brother. She relationship with them is laden with guilt and resentment. When she gets a phone call that her parents are dead, she wastes no time going home, though. As much as she dreads going home she knows she must go. Louise's brother, Mark, seems to have fared even worse than she has with the moving on from their past, which is actually a part of their present. They need to sell their parents' house but that stalls almost before it starts. Louise and Mark can't stop fighting, extremely weird things keep happening, and the horror with house and their past is ramping up quickly. Is it the house, the contents, the people or all three of those things?It was hard to care though. Louise and Mark aren't very nice people. They may have their reasons and a puppet named Pupkin may be at the head of them but the story is too long and drawn out for me to care enough. At the same time, I know this is a story that others will like a lot. It's funny and horrific and may bring back memories of other haunted objects if that's your kind of thing. I'll be happy to never hear or see the name Pupkin again. Publication: January 17, 2023Thank you to Elisha at Berkley and NetGalley for this ARC.",460,3
How to Sell a Haunted House,Booked and Busy,74,"1,113",1,"This is honestly one of the worst books I’ve ever have had the misfortune of reading. I feel so bad that given our current ecological crisis and the massive paper shortage, that even a single tree had to die for this book to be printed. RIP to the trees 🌲",432,11
How to Sell a Haunted House,LTJ,154,186,4,"“How to Sell a Haunted House” by Grady Hendrix was one of those novels I could not wait to read in 2023. I’m a huge fan of Hendrix as he’s easily one of the best horror authors out there as all his books are unique, creepy, and well, horrific. It’s also great that he adds that touch of dark humor to tie it all together to make each book a memorable read.Now, before I jump into my review, I wanted to let you know of two trigger warnings. If you’re triggered by 9/11 or the insinuation of violence against dogs, those are mentioned in this novel. Please note, Hendrix does a great job not describing or getting into details about violence against dogs, it just insinuates it. As a dog owner, this didn’t bother me at all and I appreciate he wrote it the way he did, so keep that in mind.Moving along, I had no idea what I was getting into with this novel. I enjoyed the characters and pure creepiness to start things off. As a huge rock and metalhead, I loved the Nirvana reference as they were the first band I ever got into so bonus points for that. Even more bonus points for Hendrix thanks to the Stephen King and Shirley Jackson references, two of my all-time favorite authors.In this novel, Hendrix once again showcased his phenomenal writing skills as there were several events and situations that were scary beyond belief. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything for you but there were at least 3-5 truly bizarre events that totally and completely blew my mind. I’m talking insanely horrific scenes that I had to re-read a few times because they were that wild and caused me to make faces.Now, to be honest, I felt a few times while reading things dragged on just a bit. This is a complete package of a novel so besides all the horror, character development, and lots of undermining tones of family, religion, mental health, etc., I just got a bit zoned out when I wanted more horror, you know? I love a good story but I felt that if this novel maybe had 50-75 pages trimmed, it would have been a tighter, perfect read.That’s the only ding I’m giving this novel as for the most part, I genuinely loved it. The great climactic building to the insane ending was absolutely fantastic and well, brilliant. I didn’t expect any of that to go down as that totally and completely rocked. I simply couldn’t put this novel down at all towards the end because I was that hooked.I give “How to Sell a Haunted House” by Grady Hendrix a 4/5 as it was a pretty solid read. This novel felt like a modern Child’s Play but taken to a whole new level that I didn’t expect at all. I grew up in the 80s/90s and this has similar vibes to it. The horror scenes, characters, dialogue, and overall plot were very well done by Hendrix. If it weren’t for the few times things dragged on a bit, this would have been a perfect 5/5 in my book. Regardless, I’d highly recommend this to anyone that loves horror or Hendrix as it’s definitely worth reading. Pupkin was here.",307,8
How to Sell a Haunted House,Anne,"4,165",69.8k,4,"Demonic Puppets. Possessed dolls. FAMILY.It's really that last thing that will give you the shivers.Because if you grew up in a weird one, nothing will scare you more than having to go back home and face your fucked-up blood relations. However, if your mom spent her spare time making Christian puppets and collecting dolls, you're in a class all by yourself. You, my friend, get a pass on Christmas and Thanksgiving.No one expects you to go home.Ever.On a side note, I did a stint in my church's Puppet Ministry when I was in middle school, so this book hit me on all the levels. I know what you're thinking, Random Goodreader <-- that Anne is so multi-talented! Reading AND puppets? Is there anything she can't do? Alright. I'll stop.I have to tip my hat to Hendrix because he really nails the voice of that southern religious woman. Perfection, sir. Also. Charleston, South Carolina. It is lovely.But seriously. Come on down to Columbia, Grady. We might be a little more grubby and a tad less touristy, but we still have prayer warriors who will wrap you in a Jesus burrito. Bless.Ok, this takes a little while to get going as Hendrix sets the family scene with little to no horror in sight for quite a good bit. I'd almost forgotten this was supposed to be a spooky story by the time the freaking dolls started moving around and the damn puppet started acting the fool.And normally, I don't like stories that drag on, but this time it worked. Every time I thought the story was going one way or I had a bead on the characters, the author would give the rug a little yank and I'd be on my ass asking what the hell just happened.I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say that this was a good tale.And I now believe that those damn puppets we had in the Children's Ministry at my old church were probably 100% possessed by demons.Recommended for horror fans and puppeteers.",281,3

How to Sell a Haunted House,Mort,688,"1,444",5,"HOW TO SELL A HAUNTED HOUSE – GRADY HENDRIXFull review available at The Mort Report:https://www.uncomfortablydark.com/bla...When it comes to characterization, a good author can make his characters believable in their actions and dialogue. A great author can make you wonder if he actually lived their lives. Guess where Hendrix falls…Look, I am going to get this out of the way at the start: This is a 400 page novel with a lot of character development. For those who are looking for a fast, back-to-back action story, this one is going to annoy you. You become part of these characters’ lives before the horror starts.Also, while there is still some humor here, it might be little less than the usual Grady Hendrix story.There might be more of an ‘adult’ feel for those who have judged his previous work as not serious enough for their taste.And that’s where I am going to draw my line in the sand:While this is the longest (and probably slowest) story I have read this year, I thought it was fucking brilliant. The second half of this novel picks up the pace and action, and it makes the journey with the characters worthwhile.So…in this one we have puppets. While some might say it is a lost art form, most people don’t get the appeal in the digital age anymore. Which might make it hard for some people to relate – the relationship between puppet and human, that is – and the magic it can create.And I have to admit, I am not one who can get swept up in puppet magic. But, for everything you don’t get about art, there are always the exceptions to the rules. What’s the point I’m trying to make, you ask? Somewhere, out there, beneath the…oops, getting carried away. Okay, let’s take something that is generally considered…well, shit?Mimes.Now, you only get three kinds of people in the world.The first hates mimes.The seconds don’t hate them, but if their car lost control and they were about to plunge into a crowd of people, they will be aiming for the mime.The third are mimes themselves, who would fall into the first category because they hate the competition but they have an intense love of themselves.However, have you heard of David Armand?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPlSW...(For those of you who couldn’t see the link, Google “David Armand Torn”)What this guy has done with famous songs is beyond hilarious. I have watched this about a thousand times and it never stopped being funny. Do yourself a favor, watch his other stuff on YouTube too – he is brilliant! In fact, I am willing to bet that most people who have seen him will swerve away from him if they are the second person and aim for James Blunt…okay, bad example, most people will aim for him to start with, but let’s not offend any fans of other celebrities…So, whether you like mimes (secretly, of course) or not, this guy is entertaining enough to become famous for miming and I think he is brilliant.And the secret is this; write a story about a mime getting killed and most readers would not care. But write a character like David Armand getting killed and the fans will riot.Which brings me back to my point (finally) – I don’t care for puppets or puppeteers, really, but I cared about every single one of these characters in this book.And that’s what Grady Hendrix does so well, especially in this story.I’m not going to say much more – read the blurb, heed my warning and don’t bitch about this one taking a while to get going. For the story that was told, I can’t think of anyone being able to do it better.5 and a half STARS!!",216,0
How to Sell a Haunted House,Jayme,"1,251","2,812",3,"Fans of Grady Hendrix and his CAMPY HORROR should be thrilled with his latest offering, “How To Sell A Haunted House” …but it’s much more CREEPY, than it is SPOOKY. What would make Louise and Mark Joyner’s parents leave their house in such a hurry, the night they lost their lives in a car accident on rain slicked roads?The TV was still on, her Mom’s purse on the counter, her Dad’s cane on the floor and a half eaten Turkey sandwich in the fridge. Oh, and the Attic had been nailed shut. This is what Louise and Mark find when they show up to clear out their parent’s home in preparation for sale. That and their Mom’s CREEPY DOLL collection sitting in the living room, watching the TV. Yes, this house isn’t haunted by “people gone too soon”-it is possessed by dolls and puppets. “A Puppet is a possession that possesses the possessor” And, there is one Puppet, named Punkin, who is clearly in charge. “Punkin home! Punkin home forever!” And, he isn’t about to let you sell his house out from under him! 😳I LOVED “The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Vampire Slaying” (my first Hendrix) but, since I don’t watch Slasher films, much of “The Final Girl Support Group” went over my head. This book would determine if Hendrix is or isn’t an author for me. While, I think it’s now safe to say, that he probably ISN’T, I do think that fans of HIS and fans of horror stories starring demonic dolls and possessed puppets WILL enjoy this one and it’s AVAILABLE NOW!3.5 ⭐️Thank You to Berkley for the gifted copy provided through NetGalley, in exchange for a candid review!",222,8

How to Sell a Haunted House,Chantel,413,235,1,"It is important to note that the majority of the themes explored in this book deal with sensitive subject matters. My review, therefore, touches on these topics as well. Many people might find the subject matters of the book as well as those detailed in my review overwhelming. I would suggest you steer clear of both if this is the case. Please note that from this point forward I will be writing about matters which contain reflections on abuse, child endangerment, violence, parental neglect, psychological distress, violence against a child, the death of a child, grief, & others. I won’t lie to you—I skimmed the bulk of this book. I always begin reviews with a recap. I go through, as a tertiary party, & reflect on what has taken place in an attempt to draw myself into what I have to say. I do not necessarily feel the need to do that in this case because the redundant, flippant nature of the horrifically mundane, trite, & dull plot was so graphically corny that my mind clocked out when the first hand struck the hour. This is very harsh criticism, I understand that. However, in 1993 R.L. Stine published “Night of the Living Dummy” for young readers & was able to incite, in under 200 pages, what this novel failed to glimpse in over 400.The reader meets Louise & is immediately aware of the lack of direction this story will undertake. The story circles around itself endlessly—all without reason. I became confused as to whether the author was simply trying to render Louise an unreliable narrator or if they had actually forgotten that we as the reader were meant to be engaged & attentive to the material they were presenting. Louise’s character adds to the false premise of security. Certainly, there are reasons why she is this way; always believing herself to be the only person on earth who had a less-than-stellar experience at some point in life. Though this ignorance might have added to her narrative it was incredibly dull to have to read. At once Louise tells the reader that she was never given anything by her parents, though certainly, money must grow on trees for her to have been able to have all the luxurious extracurricular activities that she was able to pursue on a whim. Yet, we then read that her family was in fact very financially insecure for several years of her childhood so, why does she believe that everything money can buy is her due? Louise tells the reader that money from her parent’s inheritance would help her buy a house with a yard so she could have a dog & give Poppy, her daughter, more freedom. Then, she turns around & tells us that she lied to Poppy for her complacency—she’s never going to buy a dog. What does this add to the story? I do not think that Louise is unreliable, I think that she is a poorly constructed character. This is supported by the same lack of continuity within the story at large. For example, in one scene Louise has not yet cried about her parents’ death. When she lay on her childhood bed she began to cry for the first time. This is evidently forgotten by the author because a couple of chapters later Louise is described as crying for the first time with Constance. This same formula is employed throughout the novel for a multitude of things which leaves me feeling that the author lost track of their original intention. I can appreciate that Louise felt disconnected within her family unit because her parents seemed to be coddling her brother, Mark, even when it seemed he didn’t deserve it. I suppose it’s an act of sheer ignorance that keeps Louise from noting her own failures as a human being. Her focus is locked into all the shortcomings of her brother, whom she cannot fathom as being anything less than a burden on society. I mention this fact because I grew tired of hearing about their quibbles. This is also why I reference R.L. Stine’s 1993 book—this relationship is identical to the one that the sisters share in his book. Wouldn’t it have been wonderful to have seen one member of the family act like a fully formed entity within this plot? Am I meant to think it’s funny that Mark has to attempt to validate his emotions after his sister sliced his arm off? Are we meant to all laugh & giggle about silly Mark, who almost died & was denied his experiences, trying once again to find solace in the heart of a person who was as hollow as the Tin Man? I think not. The crux of this story is technically one I might be interested in watching play out in a cinematic medium. Poltergeist stories are incredibly difficult to write. I believe that the author has to have the trust of the reader, before anything else, so that the reveals are subtle; actions leading the reader to question how they might interpret the situation if it were happening to them. I should not be laughing & rolling my eyes while reading about a demon-possessed hand puppet that is trying to murder & possess human beings. Though this story has been done a thousand times, a skilled author—someone with a mind for details & gore—would be able to present the essence of this fear in a way that makes a reader forget its familiarity. I should not be reading a book & think about all the times I had seen this same premise carried out in smoother strokes. I cannot fault someone for trying something; I know this book will be loved by many readers. Thankfully, the world is filled with people who are different from me—it’s part of our charm as human beings, there are so many of us, all a bit different though similar, to one another. Because of this fact, I can appreciate that some readers will come across this book & appreciate the cheesy dialogue. They won’t care that Pupkin—the poltergeist—leaps out of a closet like a demented frog in the middle of the night to hound a child who would just as soon forget he exists as spent her lifetime of energy following his orders. What would Pupkin achieve by having everyone kill each other? Genuinely, where do you go when the family that houses you is dead? You’re a puppet, you can’t just waltz out of the house given you rely on the energy & spirit of the living beings in the house. Or maybe you don’t? I don’t know, most of the details of his entity are—like those of every other character—unclear. Having said that I really enjoy stories of poltergeists. The premise is one that has great potential. I truly believe that with proper, steady & diligent editing, this story could make for a wonderful screenplay. I laughed my way through the scenes with the taxidermy squirrels. I could not find anything frightening about a trio of blinded carcasses standing around the room whilst Louise—a fully grown adult human—loomed in fear. In the region in which I live, squirrels are massive. They can become very, very chunky so I appreciate that if a 10+-pound squirrel was threatening me, my heartbeat would pick up but…I’m also a fully grown adult human being, I recognize my options in this situation. This leads me to my next point, Louise is intent on being useless. She never thinks ahead, & never takes a moment to reflect on how her actions will impact those around her. She is very selfish yet, she pretends that everything she does is because she is duty-bound to act. She simply shoots off to Poppy, right before she is meant to go to bed, that her beloved grandparents have died. She degrades Mark because he was drinking before calling her to tell her of their parent’s passing. She thinks that the funeral arrangements are wrong because she never thought to consider that her parents might be unknown to her, far away in her secret-keeping life. I digress, we could go in circles along with the story on these points. Louise is not a character worth following & her bickering is tiresome. Inconsistencies do not a scary story make. Perhaps for some readers, but, I am no such one. I would have appreciated it if Louise had remembered saying that the trash was going to be collected when she dumped Pupkin inside. Yet, we read about her freaking out because she didn’t see his doll body in the garbage, days later, when she looked. I didn’t care that the TV kept being turned on. I would have loved for this to have been the introduction to something eerie & torrential but, instead, I’m met with the comical squeaks of dead squirrels & an old possessed puppet that acted like a dead battery. All that to say, this book was not for me. I was eager to read it—I have heard so much praise for this author & their work. Ultimately, I wanted something more mature, something more pointed. I wanted bat caves of steaming breath without a body. I wanted limp ragtag arms swaying in dead air. I wanted the slightly slow-moving painted eyes of the possessed to glimmer in a sun that the characters would never see shine again.",147,0

Her parents are surprisingly supportive and as we all do, Louise thinks she’ll have years ahead with them. One evening her estranged, waste of space brother Mark (Louise’s opinion!) rings to tell her they’ve been killed in a car crash in their native city of Charleston. When she arrives at their house everything, absolutely everything feels wrong giving her chills and bad vibes. She makes discoveries that seriously disturb her, then she thinks she must be hallucinating but it’s the sealed up attic that really rattles her bones. What on earth is going on at the house???Oh boy, what have I just read??!! It sure taps into some of my phobias IN A BIG WAY but it does so in such an entertaining way though I doubt I could watch if it’s ever made into a movie!! Some things really do creep you out, make you hot under the collar whilst also raising the hairs in the back of your neck! The claustrophobia is so intense at times - let me out of here!!!! At one point I genuinely do yell ‘Oh no, no, no, no, no’ rather loudly which raises an eyebrow elsewhere in the room! There are some freaky, scary scenes and so I need all my braves not to jump out of my own skin. Yet, yet, it’s also really darned funny, quirky, original, creative, imaginative, crazy, mad, weird and totally creeptastic! How clever to be able to combine funny and ‘feary’ in the same book, what a skill. The characters are excellent, on one I admit to a massive U-turn when you learn more as the novel progresses with the two lead protagonists being made of stern stuff if not titanium. The dialogue is also really good with the author sometimes making me hoot with laughter whilst at others covering my eyes which is not helpful when reading! I like the ending which is very satisfying.

How to Sell a Haunted House,Rachel Hanes,555,394,3,"I’m not even sure where to start with this review… I will say that I thought the five different parts of this book were labeled brilliantly. Each part/section was labeled as the five stages of grief. We had Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. Loved it! However, each chapter within a section was soooo long, I started to lose interest in this book about halfway through. We not only had super long chapters, but this story became quite bizarre and outlandish, that it was hard to take seriously. In this story we have the main character of Louise who comes back to her childhood home after her parents are killed in a tragic car accident. Louise has to deal with her estranged brother Mark, and also all the stuff that her mother has collected over the years- specifically dolls and puppets. These were not cute and “friendly” dolls and puppets, but dolls that were haunting the house. 🫣At first, I was super invested in this story. I liked hearing about both Louise’s and Mark’s backstories. Then after the ‘Bargaining’ section, things pretty much went downhill for me. We have a puppet named Pupkin, who pretty much runs the show. Either, I’m just not a big fan of puppets- or I just wasn’t buying this story. Either way, I do not want any dolls or puppets near me after reading this. This was my first Grady Hendrix read, and I will be looking into some of his other books that seem to have much better praise. This one just didn’t sit all that well with me.

How to Sell a Haunted House,Chelsea Humphrey,"1,487",81.5k,3,"”We are not weird… My family is not weird… We are not weird… We’re as normal as every other family.”Another year, another Grady Hendrix novel under my belt. While this one wasn’t my favorite, it still consisted of a well crafted, slow burning and thought provoking storyline that many will enjoy. The reasoning behind my middle of the road rating is more personal than objective, as it contains a horror trope that I’m just not a fan of. Possessed, killer dolls are a plot device that just will never speak to me. I definitely encourage readers to try this for themselves, though, as it will be a favorite for many old school horror aficionados.Where this novel shines, in my humble opinion, is in the writing of this family’s broken moments of grief. We ride alongside this sibling duo and see them process their complicated feelings about their parents who have passed suddenly, and the ups and downs add some character depth as the suspense builds around the house that is haunted. Honestly, how many of us can relate to having complex emotions surrounding our family, immediate or extended? If you have been waiting for Hendrix to return to a traditional haunting type of story, this is it. I appreciate how widely he can pen a story in the horror category, and I look forward to what he writes next. If nothing else, I’ll definitely make sure my attic is secured tightly before sleeping again. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.",123,0
How to Sell a Haunted House,Gareth Is Haunted,338,62,5,"Grady Hendrix treats us to an incredible slice of campy modern horror. A wild, creepy and yet touching read which left me almost lost for words.'Every childhood home is haunted, and each of us are possessed by our parents.'I'm already a huge fan of Grady Hendrix and this new novel has exceeded all my expectations of his work. Hendrix has a knack for making the most mundane of day-to-day actions or observations into something sinister or amusing. I had moments where I didn't know whether to laugh, cry or be scared out of my skin.Although many of the events in this book are utterly outrageous they still have a grounding in the real world and are so relatable, especially when it comes to our families and childhood memories. The writing, characters and interactions between characters were so bold, rich, vivid and full of life that you could have believed that these characters and events were real. 'You know, Louise, her dad said, statistically, and there's a lot of variance in these numbers, but in general, from a strictly scientific point of view, everything turns out okay an improbable number of times.'I have been very conscious not to leave any kind of spoilers or even a synopsis in my review. I believe this book is best experienced without knowing too much about it. That said, I suppose the title itself may give you an idea.I could not rate this title any more highly, this book has something for everyone.Move over Annabelle, move over Chucky, Pupkin is the new pretender to the crown!Thank you to Titan Books and Netgalley for providing me with an ARC copy for review.",128,0

This situation is a catalyst for an overwhelming amount of personal discovery. The two must painfully work through family secrets in order to sell their haunted house.My Reading Experience: How to Sell A Haunted House is officially my favorite Grady Hendrix novel now. I love this book. I enjoyed every, single minute I spent here. The way everything unravels both slowly (methodically) at first and then fast & fiercely toward the end is genius. Hendrix introduces readers to the main protagonist, Louise, giving us careful insight into her relationship with her brother, Mark. We see everything through the lens of her experience and worldview.And this is where the genius comes in because we develop this relationship with Louise, right? We get everything we need from her perspective. And this is a lot like real life too, the people we are close to, friends and family, co-workers, etc. their experiences and their narrative about what's happening in their life is filtered to us the way they tell it. They can decide to spin a story the way they choose to influence our perception of how we see it. They can leave out some details, they can add to it a little, or they can outright lie to make us believe they are the hero of the story and someone else is the villain. But if we wanted to, we could ask the other person, the ""villain"" how it all went down and the narrative would be a little different, wouldn't it? Depending on what's at stake.Hendrix reminds us that there are two sides to every story. Maybe even more.Every complicated situation or event could be told from multiple POVs. The truth is in there somewhere, but getting to that source of information is complicated and in this case, dangerous. I love the way we get a lot from Louise and Mark but we don't get the fuller picture until the circle widens to include other family members, and holy hell, I love this family. Aunt Gail, Mercy, Aunt Honey... it's a powerful thing that only Grady Hendrix can do and that's his ability to give fictional characters all that quirk and weirdness. SO GOOD! So laugh-out-loud funny. Sometimes I feel like authors don't really *see* or *hear* their characters and so I have a hard time seeing them or hearing them too--they all kind of look or sound the same right? Not in a Grady Hendrix book. These people ARE REAL. The dialogue is REAL. Cinematic. That's some bookish magic.This is possession horror.Yes, there are puppets, dolls, and a haunted house. And two jump scares.BUTThere is also the possession of truth. How it is decided who knows and who doesn't get to know. That gravitational pull some families have where everything is centered around one person, or one event, or a secret, a lie. And everything is centered around that whole thing like a rotten core of an apple spoiling the family from the inside out.Generational dysfunction passed on from one cult of personality to the next. Goddamn. I'll be thinking about this one for a long time. Because honestly, the only way some families can heal from a bad thing is a catalyst of destruction. A disruptor. In the case of this book, How to Sell a Haunted House, the journey of discovery is EVERYTHING. Broken relationships.Haunted people.A haunted house with a haunted past.MY FAVORITE GRADY HENDRIX BOOK!! I laughed, I cried, and I was terrified.Final Recommendation: If you are looking for an intricately plotted haunted house story infused with a tale of possession and mixed with a domestic drama complete with suspense and mystery, you will love this book as much as I did. Comps: The Book of Accidents by Chuck Wendig (kind of), I don't know! I can't think of anything quite like this with the family dynamic and the humor, the fun, and the scares.",128,0

Louise is heartbroken to find out both of her parents died in a car accident. She’s also horrified that her estranged brother, Mark, didn’t call her until the next day. He’s always been selfish that way. They do not get along whatsoever, but now have to come together to clean out their parents house and put it on the market.But…it seems like there’s something in the house that doesn’t want it to be sold. Strange, unexplainable things start occurring, and Louise and Mark soon realize that the house is haunted…by a puppet and dolls that their mom made. …and that kind of lost me. I prefer “haunted house” stories involving ghosts…paranormal activity. Puppets and dolls don’t quite do it for me. However, after my slight disappointment, I do have to say that there were many aspects of the book I enjoyed. It’s entertaining in a ridiculous way, and even sometimes funny. I loved the dynamics between Louise and Mark, which got more interesting as the story continued. I didn’t find it scary, but it’s definitely an amusing read. 3.5 starsThank you to Berkley for providing me with a widget of the ARC through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

How to Sell a Haunted House,Lex Kent,"1,683","9,125",4,"3.50 Stars. That was quite the ride. I was super excited about this book. If you’ve followed my reviews for any time period, you will know how much I love paranormal anything, plus book horror. So naturally, all of Grady’s books have looked right up my alley but unfortunately, I just have not had the time to read them. I did watch My Best Friend's Exorcism, and didn’t really care for it, but I heard many people say the book was so much better so it’s still on the list to read eventually. Anyway, when I saw this new book, a book about a haunted house by Grady, I thought the stars aligned because even better than a haunted person, is a good old fashion haunted house. I could not request this book fast enough I was so excited. It is not until two weeks ago that I read the blurb right before I was ready to start the book that I realize that this wasn’t really a modern Grady spin on an old school fashion haunted house story, this was Grady’s spin on object possession, aka creepy f@cking dolls/puppets. I don’t know what it is about old dolls with dead eyes, but I think I watched too many ghost, reality shows about those real dolls that are supposedly cursed or have demons attached or whatever but I just can’t with them. I mean they made movies off of these real dolls they are so scary, heck I couldn’t even watch the new Chucky show since possessed dolls bother me so much now, while I remember back in the day watching Bride of Chucky with no issues, just to support Jennifer Tilly like any queer gen Xer young woman would. How was I, with this possessed doll phobia, going to read Grady’s new book when I knew he was going to push it to the max? Well this is why this review is a bit late because I could not decide what to do. I finally decided to read it and if it was to much, skim or DNF. I’m happy to announce that I was able to read the whole thing. There were two scenes I did fast read, but I was able to get through everything. The horror wasn’t scary per say, it was intense and weird and the book actually had a vibe of Chucky, but the story was completely different. When it came to the story itself, I thought it was okay. I liked Grady’s writing and found it very easy to get lost in the book, even with a subject I actively disliked. Besides the horror parts, the main storyline really is about the relationship of a brother and sister who don’t get along and in fact can’t stand each other. You find yourself instantly siding with one character, and you soon find out that there are always two sides to every story, and I thought Grady did a really good job on showing that. There are some twists and turns in this book and while they are not too surprising, they are definitely fun to read. In the end, I don’t think people will claim this is Grady’s best, but I do think it was an entertaining slightly above average read. If you are a Grady fan or love Childs Play, Chucky, or just creepy dolls and puppets, than this just might be the horror book for you. My thanks to Berkley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.",93,0

A House with Good Bones,LTJ,154,186,4,"“A House With Good Bones” by T. Kingfisher is the second novel I’ve read by her as I loved “What Moves the Dead” and couldn’t wait to read more of her work. Her writing style is excellent and when it comes to the horror aspect of her novels, they are top-notch.Now, before I begin my review, I found two trigger warnings while reading that I wanted everyone to be aware of. They were…- Sleep paralysis- Violence against insectsIf this triggers you, please do not read this novel. Moving along, this was a solid horror novel that hits you with haunted houses and ghost vibes throughout reading. It’s subtle but once it starts happening, it’s fantastic. If you love bugs in any way, shape, or form, you will love reading this novel.Insect horror if done right can definitely send chills down your spine and the few situations that happened here did exactly that for me. Besides that, I love Kingfisher’s humor as I had some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in this one. It added a nice touch to the entire reading experience.Another area that connected with me was all the awesome references Kingfisher threw in here. From The Real Ghostbusters cartoon show, Dungeons & Dragons, La Llorona, The Crow, and even The Shining, these all brought a smile to my face.The characters were great and I enjoyed the family drama as a whole. It just all makes sense, especially when you get to the second half of the novel. The only thing is, this novel starts off solid then goes into a slow burn. The story fizzled out a bit at around the halfway mark as things started to drag on.The main protagonist, Sam, is an Entomologist so I get it. There’s a lot of stuff on Entomology that I felt wasn’t really all that needed. Again, if you love insects, the history of them, all sorts of fancy terms, and some horrific situations involving them, this would definitely add another layer of immersion. I don’t mind insect horror but for me, anything to do with roaches would definitely scare the hell out of me. Luckily, no roaches at all here much to my delight.Thankfully, at around the 75% mark, things started to finally pick up tremendously. My goodness, this novel took a very creepy turn that was a genuine ZOMG horror moment! Once that happened, I made many weird faces while reading because it was that terrifying. It was one of the most unique horror moments I’ve ever experienced. I’ve never read anything so bizarre, freaky, and wild.Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but that more than made up for the parts that started to drag. It was perfect timing too since once that happened, the climactic race to the end was so much fun. That buildup to the ending was exciting and action-packed with some nice twists at the end.I give “A House With Good Bones” by T. Kingfisher a 4/5 as it’s a very good haunted house novel with an insect horror twist. This was another fun read by her as once again, her horror is unique and memorable. I love innovative horror so much and Kingfisher once again delivered as she does best. The only drawback is that this is definitely a slow-burn read with a few parts that dragged on but I assure you, it’s definitely worth it once you get to the spine-chilling parts and big reveal towards the end. I will never look at ladybugs the same ever again.",194,39

She understands the gentle balances in nature and has a keen sense for when things aren't quite right.That's exactly what Sam feels when she arrives for a visit at her mother's house in North Carolina and sees vultures flying overhead and one perched on top of the mailbox out front. That's unusual.The interior of the house that was once charmingly cluttered and colorful, now has white walls, a sterile feel, and decor that's disturbing and dates back to when her grandmother was alive.

Could it be dementia?When Sam starts digging around for answers inside and out, it's alarming what she finds...A House with Good Bones is my first read by this author and what a treat! It's delightfully written with the perfect slow build beginning, quickening pace in the middle, and full force heightened ending. Clearly, for me, the highlight of this story was the personable, compassionate, and well educated main character, Sam. I enjoyed her sense of humor and thoughtful use of a colorful word or two that was quite unexpected from someone so well spoken. I appreciate when descriptive language of this type fits into a story so well. Listening to the audiobook narrator Mary Robinette Kowal was a wonderful experience. She became the character of Sam, as well as giving perfect gender voicing for an eclectic mix of unusual characters, which was no small feat, in my opinion. I will definitely remember this narration.I'm so glad I finally tried this author's work. It was an entertaining, humorous, creepy, good time that I will definitely repeat again... soon!

A House with Good Bones,Teres,110,359,3,"Well that was… different?A House With Good Bones is my first novel by acclaimed author T. Kingfisher so I have nothing to compare it to.What I can say is that it left me questioning: is paranormal-horror her usual genre?I do know that she has a rather rabid fan base, so if you are one, perhaps you could kindly let me know.Our heroine in this story is 32-year-old Samantha Montgomery, an archaeoentomologist. In layman’s terms, she examines dead bugs at archeological sites. A surprisingly applicable skill set as it turns out — there are several infestations she’s going to have to deal with before the book’s conclusion.On furlough from an archeological dig, Sam has returned to her family home in North Carolina for an extended visit. The bad omens start immediately as Sam is greeted by a vulture perched on the mailbox, keeping a close eye on the house.It’s pretty clear to Sam from the get go that something strange is afoot on Lammergeier Lane: Mom’s acting quite skittish and odd; the interior of the house has been completely redecorated in a style very unlike her mother’s taste; framed artwork and photographs suddenly fall off the wall; and swarms of ladybugs emerge from the faucets and drains.Despite these unsettling events, Sam spends the first 80 percent of the book perched on the sofa, eating pizza, drinking boxed wine, and watching British crime shows on television.With her scientific background and scholarly mind, Sam looks for rational reasons behind the ominous occurrences.The story is narrated in Sam’s dry, sarcastic voice. We are privy to her lengthy asides about bugs, near constant droll and chatty inner musings, and self-mockery. Reminiscent of a stand-up comedy routine, I honestly kept waiting to hear a rimshot. The more serious horror-paranormal elements kick in toward the final 20 percent of the novel with a rather jarring and contrasting dark tonal shift.Whoa, okay, I guess the comedy routine has ended.While the humor may be missing during these viscerally climactic scenes, it’s replaced with plenty of nail-biting tension, coupled with gory and creepy details to make any reader squirm.Given the long buildup in the first 80 percent of the book, Kingfisher resolves the final conflict rather abruptly and ties things up a little too neatly for my taste. Still, if you’re looking to have your hackles raised, A House With Good Bones ought to do the trick. Oh, and say hi to Hermes for me. 𓄿",140,0
A House with Good Bones,,,,4,"My complete review of A House with Good Bones is published at Grimdark Magazine.T. Kingfisher combines Lovecraftian horror with a charming sense of humor in A House with Good Bones, her new Southern Gothic novel about unearthing long-lost family secrets.Kingfisher has crafted an irresistibly delightful narrator in Samantha Montgomery, a thirty-two-year-old post-doctoral scholar in archaeoentomology, a field at the intersection of archaeology and entomology. As the novel opens, Sam has returned to her family home in North Carolina. The bad omens start immediately, as Sam is greeted by a vulture perched on their mailbox, keeping a close eye on the house.Sam is alarmed at the sight of her mother, who has lost substantial weight and seems unusually anxious. The house itself feels strange, with its brightly colored walls now painted a dull white and old decorations from her late grandmother on display throughout the home. Sam is understandably worried about her mother, determined to uncover what is driving her strange behavior.Sam is an absolute joy as narrator of A House with Good Bones. Her droll and somewhat garrulous sense of humor kept me chuckling on almost every page. I especially enjoyed Sam’s nerdy digressions on insects and other arthropods, which acted as a lighthearted balance to the dark family secrets that she eventually unearths. Sam’s humor also serves as an effective vehicle to provide biting commentary on racism and generational conflict in the Old South.The problem with A House with Good Bones is that the main plot twist is painfully obvious from early in the book, although Sam herself is oblivious to the clues. Nevertheless, it is a treat to read Sam’s thoughts as she employs her scientific training to attempt rationalization of the irrational. Kingfisher is especially adept at presenting the mind of a scientist at work.The horror aspects of A House with Good Bones kick into overdrive in the last fifth of the book, causing the narrative style to shift accordingly. The humor is largely missing during these final climactic scenes, replaced with enough gory detail to make any reader squirm. The final conflict is resolved too abruptly, especially given the long buildup in the first eighty percent of the novel. Ultimately the various plot threads are tied up a little too easily for my taste. Still, I greatly enjoyed the journey.Notwithstanding its shortcomings in the final part of the book, A House with Good Bones is a charming and highly entertaining read. Although I was underwhelmed by its rather predictable horror aspects, Kingfisher kept me smiling throughout most of the novel.",113,0

A House with Good Bones,A Mac,882,167,3,"Actual Rating 3.5 After Sam’s archaeological fieldwork is put on pause, she decides to stay with her mom in North Carolina. Especially since her brother recently called and told her something seemed odd with their mom. Sam does notice a few small changes, but nothing too alarming. But things escalate, and she starts to wonder if maybe she was wrong. As more questions arise and spookier things begin to happen, Sam does her best to cling to facts and discover what she can about their family’s dark past.This was an eerie read that was fast-paced and difficult to put down. I loved the details included relating to archaeology and how it was incorporated throughout the work. They were relatable and legitimate, and the quote comparing the value of burials versus trash heaps/middens sounded like it came from a true archaeologist. I enjoyed the sass of the main character and her personality overall, though there wasn’t much growth or development beyond how she’s initially introduced. She definitely wasn’t a serious protagonist, and I think this actually detracted some from the atmosphere of this work (it missed the southern gothic mark for me). The slow build of the tension and spookiness was well done, though it did take a while for that to get started. The history that was incorporated added some interesting details to this read. I had a bit of a hard time with how absurd some of the big reveals felt, but I enjoyed the ride getting to them. Also, shoutout to the narrator for doing the BEST southern old lady voice I’ve heard in a long time. This slow burn, spooky work of magical realism was solid entertainment despite the few qualms I had with it. My thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for allowing me to read this work.

A House with Good Bones,Mara,"1,752","4,060",5,"4.5 stars - I would describe the tone of T Kingfisher's horror as normcore; she's not going to create a creepy atmosphere with flowery prose or elaborately described settings. Rather, she uses very ordinary people in very ordinary settings and then allows the dread to grow.

I enjoyed The Twisted Ones and The Hollows and couldn’t wait to read her newest offering. I love reading Gothic thrillers, and this seemed like one that I would enjoy. Sam is hilarious and her quirky sense of humor captured my attention immediately. She is a great protagonist, but most of the book is spent listening to her inner monologue. There are just a few characters in this book, and it took a very long time for them to begin to interact with one another. This book follows a Lovecraftian plot line that ultimately wasn’t as compelling as I had hoped.

It even attempts to be funny and quirky at times.The main problem is that right from the start you know what's happening, while the main character, Sam, is in denial. So what you get is 80% of her being all logical and rational and refusing to see what is obvious, and in the last 20% there's some action that doesn't make too much sense. I can't say that I predicted everything that happens, but nothing surprised me here because the author kept hinting at the same things over and over again.

Sam is a scientist and a skeptic, but coming home to stay with her mom for awhile something seems....off. And things devolve from there.While this has humor and light, quirky narration style, it also has scenes that are truly creepy and disturbing. But Sam is pretty unflappable for much of the book, always seeking a logical explanation and that balances things quite well. She's also a fat woman who is comfortable in her own skin and I LOVED how this tackled fatphobia in the medical industry among other things. I don't know that I've seen this kind of thing included in a book casually like that before and I was so impressed. So yeah, definitely among my favorite things I've read from T. Kingfisher. I seem to do well with a lot of her horror and that's certainly what this is. With a side of family trauma!

But ultimately, i just didnt enjoy this one, or the setting, or the characters we were introduced to.

So, Sam goes home. She is looking forward to spending time with her mother while enjoying a break from her job as an archaeoentomologist (Bugs are her thing).Sam instantly notices that her mother is not quite herself. Her mother is guarded and anxious. She is no longer the carefree mother she knew. Soon other things begin to seem different in the house as well. Her mother has repainted the walls. They were once painted vibrant colors that gave the house life and a cool vibe, but her mother has since painted the walls the colors her Gran Mae liked while she lived there. Then there are the ladybugs and the rose petals. By themselves they do not seem strange but trust me, they are very, very strange in this book. Plus, when vulture watch your house and only your house, be afraid because that is just creepy. How many times a day can the hairs stand up on the back of your neck? How many strange occurrences can you endure before you begin asking questions or get the heck out of there?This was a creepy and gothic feeling book. I would have been out of there lickety-split. But not Sam or her mother. As the tension mounts and things get creepier by the second, the characters find themselves in danger. I enjoyed how T. Kingfisher set the stage. It was both atmospheric and gothic. The characters were interesting and there was more to several of them than meets the eye. The creep vibe in this book was strong as was the writing. It had the right amount of tension and what-did-I-just-read moments. I didn't feel that this book was scary but enjoyed how creepy it was.

A House with Good Bones,Chelsea (gofetchabook),243,41,1,"Saying this book was not for me is an understatement. I am sitting here trying to give it a compliment sandwich, but I can’t think of one thing nice to say. Samantha is is a bug archeologist. I don’t have it in me to go back and look up the proper title she gave herself. She returns home and something is off with her mother. I can’t even describe the big final shebang at the end of the book because I didn’t even follow what was happening. The house sinks into the ground, the roses are alive, her grandmother was maybe an evil witch or sorcerer or something. It was hard to follow. Eye Twitching Annoyances- Samantha’s character was “fat” and it was referenced over and over and over and over again. It seemed like the author gave her the personality of the “funny fat girl” that you see in the early 2000’s movies. It added nothing to the plot line for her to continue to make mildly self deprecating “joking” comments about her weight while at the same time embracing it. It just missed the mark. We aren’t in the 90’s anymore. Unless it’s a major part of the story, I don’t see why someone’s body weight matters. - As mentioned above, Samantha was “funny.” She was essentially that girl that decided she was the funny girl and had to crack one liners about everything. You couldn’t get through four sentences without another *drum drum cymbal* moment because she made a joke. It wasn’t funny. It wasn’t even humorous. The side of my mouth didn’t even twitch up in the slightest. In fact I would probably quit my job if I had to work in a cubicle next to her. It was just incessant. I picture her to also be “one of the guys” and “not like other girls.” - The bug descriptions. Oh god, the bug descriptions, every time they mentioned a bug there was a whole side explanation of the class, species, fact about it. It was too much, just TOO MUCH!It added to my displeasure by listening to this as an audiobook. There’s a handyman who comes by who is supposed to be a cute potential love interest for Samantha. However, the “man voice” that the narrator did for him might actually have been the only thing I actually found humorous because he sounded like the elderly grandfather on South Park. As I said above, the first 75% of the book was boring and annoying. Then all hell broke loose really quickly, no buildup. And I wasn’t even fully sure I understood what was happening. I’ll leave you with this final thought - I felt like this book was written to be a 90’s sitcom where every few minutes, everything freezes so the main character can say something funny (which usually isn’t actually funny) to the camera about what’s going on, and then stands there patiently while the laugh track plays. I would have DNF’d this if it wasn’t the only audiobook I had readily downloaded while in the car. Less than one star.I’d recommend chewing on a wet wool mitten before I’d recommend reading this book.",60,7
A House with Good Bones,Katie Colson,703,"8,220",3,"⭐️3.5I really enjoyed this. Of her works, this is most comparable to The Hollow Places. There's a similar wit, characters and story structure. If you enjoyed one, you'll enjoy the other. I don't think this is as good as The Hollow Places but it's still damn good on it's own.The relationship between mother and daughter was particularly well done and the scary vibes of the jar of teeth and the ever present danger lingering in the house worked really well for me. I was consistently ill at ease during this read. You know something's wrong and I figured out what it was well before the character. But that didn't matter. What mattered was following her through the absolute terror her childhood home had morphed into.I would definitely suggest this read though I don't think it's in my top 5 of T. Kingfisher books.",61,0
A House with Good Bones,Michelle ,326,107,4,"In any gothic novel the atmosphere is the most important character, and I think this book was lacking a little in that area. However, the plot was creative and the book was overall funny and enjoyable. I loved all the characters but Sam, our protagonist, was so endearing. Her strength, humor and intellect set her apart from so many poorly written heroines out there. She felt like a real person, and I want to be her new best friend.",60,0
A House with Good Bones,,,,,"A HOUSE WITH GOOD BONES by T. KingfisherOther Books I Enjoyed by This Author: THE TWISTED ONES, WHAT MOVES THE DEADAffiliate Link: https://bookshop.org/a/7576/978125082...Release Date: March 28th, 2023General Genre: Fantasy, Horror, Thriller/Suspense, Southern GothicSub-Genre/Themes: Comedy, Multi-Generational Family Saga, Mothers & Daughters, Magical Realism/Occult/Paranormal, Female POVWriting Style: First-Person POV, Compelling, Intricately Plotted, Character-Driven, Dialogue What You Need to Know: You need to know that I listened to the audiobook and I thought it was great. I had a tedious task that would take about 5-6 hours so I decided to listen to a book while I accomplished my task and this was what I chose. It was perfect because there is a small cast of important characters that are mostly all women and it was narrated by a woman, so there were no awkward child voices (which I hate). There was one male character, Phil, and the narrator chose to have a sort of dopey voice for him that I didn’t care for but that’s really my only complaint on the audiobook. You also should know that while there are some creepy scenes, and a sense of dread building, for the most part, this book is light horror–even humorous. It doesn’t lean into traditional horror elements until the endMy Reading Experience: This will be a memorable experience for me. I needed to sign stacks upon stacks of my books which, by my estimation, was going to take about 5-6 hours. To keep my mind occupied, I decided to get an audiobook. Typically, I don’t have a lot of time for something like that, so I was eager to settle in with it. Over the course of three days (about 2 hours each day), I listened to this book and had the best time. Sam is a quirky lady. We get the privilege of being inside her head as she heads out to rural neighborhood in North Carolina to spend some time with her mom in her deceased grandmother’s house.Immediately she notices things are a bit “off”. Her mom is acting strange. During her stay, we get to know the family dynamics through scenes of hilarious dialogue and weird, random stuff happening in the house/garden. A few interesting characters are introduced, a neighbor who had a bit of an on-going competition with the deceased grandma and the gardener, Phil. Who may or may not be, a love interest for Sam. If bugs give you the heebie-jeebies, this one is pretty unsettling. I loved all the fascinating trivia and descriptions but people who get wigged out over that stuff will have a difficult time. The building dread as Sam continues to uncover family secrets does unfurl slowly. Toward the end, things dive into horror headlong and it gets pretty gruesome but up to that point, I’d say this is a solid horror comedy; lighthearted and fun. Final Recommendation: This is perfect for when you are craving something a little less dark and brooding. It’s a great summer read. The MC has a feisty, bubbly personality. Her asides and self-depricating humor sprinkled throughout keeps the mood of the book on the sunnier side. She’s an interesting, dynamic character with her quirky worldview and specialized job as an archaeoentomologist (studies historical bugs) There’s also witchcraft, family drama and secrets, and an exciting climax. A very entertaining, enjoyable read. I had a good time. Comps: MOTHERTHING by Ainslie Hogarth, HOW TO SELL A HAUNTED HOUSE by Grady Hendrix",58,0
A House with Good Bones,Sheyla ✎,"1,881",568,3,"I liked it well enough.Sam Montgomery is an archaeoentomologist who just finished a job in Arizona. After her brother calls her to tell her something seems off with their mother, she decides to go visit her in North Carolina. Sam is excited to spend her time off watching crime tv shows and drinking wine.Sam's mother is usually a carefree, easy-going, and stress-free woman but when Sam sees her, she can't believe this thin, jumpy, and distracted person is her mother. In addition, her home feels off too. Her mother had painted all the walls white like when her Gran Mae was alive instead of the vibrant colors they were the last time she visited. Is her mother getting dementia or is someone harassing her? And why are all these crows watching the house and her every move?A House with Good Bones had an entertaining character to keep my interest throughout. The gothic elements were well-balanced.

A House with Good Bones,megs_bookrack,"1,727",11.8k,5,"💚🖤💚🖤💚🖤💚🖤💚🖤💚🖤💚A House with Good Bones is the most recent release from T. Kingfisher, one of my favorite authors. With this being said, it's probably unsurprising that this is by far one of my most anticipated releases of 2023.Happily, this peculiar Southern Gothic tale didn't disappoint for one single second. I loved it from the first sentence.When Sam's brother calls her, expressing concern about their Mom's health and state-of-mind, Sam figures it couldn't come at a better time. With her archaeological dig site temporarily shut down, there's no time like the present to travel home to North Carolina for a visit.It's been a while. She loves her Mom. Why not go stay with her and see what she can see. If her brother is right, Sam wants to be able to help.Once back in her childhood home, Sam can feel it. Something is off. It's not just the changes that Mom has made to the house, she's acting different. It's slight things, but they definitely don't go unnoticed.Sam senses her Mom is afraid of something, but what?The mystery is deep enough that Sam is compelled to get to the bottom of it. There's no way she'll be able to leave her Mom like this. Further, Sam is prepared to kick the butt of whoever is the cause of her Mom's secret distress.Digging into it, however, requires digging into her own past and the past of her family. You never know what you're gonna find when you start digging. That Sam knows is true. She's an archaeo-entomologist after all, but even she didn't expect the Mason Jar full of human teeth buried under the rose bushes...With help from some new friends, Sam gets elbows deep in her sordid family history and tries her best to rid her mother and their property from its long shadow.Y'all, this was such an intriguing and engaging story. At this point, reading a T. Kingfisher for me is like story-time with an old friend. Her writing style is so distinct. She's like the Axel Rose of Dark Fiction. You can tell it's her from just a few lines.I always connect with Kingfisher's main characters. I think it is the sense of humor. It's the way I think and view the world, so it's super easy for me to fall into step with their thought patterns and choices.This main character, Sam, was no exception. I just got her, wow. I loved how on it she was with her Mom. She wasn't willing to look the other way. She didn't look upon her task as a burden. Something was wrong here, her mom had sacrificed so much for her, and gosh darn it, Sam wasn't leaving until she helped her in return.I appreciate how quirky and unique Kingfisher's side characters are. They contribute so much. In this one, Phil, her Mom's kind-of-cute handyman and Gail, the eccentric neighbor, who owns a one-winged vulture and may-or-may-not be a witch, were stars of the show.Gail fit nicely into one of my favorite Horror character archetypes. Let's see if I can explain this correctly... The older character, who comes into the orbit of our protagonist and teaches them, or guides them in what they need to know to survive/defeat/overcome the obstacles/issues/horrifying creatures they're dealing with, all whilst providing incredible comic relief.The atmosphere was fantastic. I loved learning about the house and all the different little things that Sam was noticing. There are some fun scenes with bugs as well.The ending got crazy. It reminded me a little of The Twisted Ones. Not so much in the content, or what happened, but just sort of how it all unfolded leading up to the conclusion. I loved that book and loved this one too.Also, the audiobook is great. I absolutely recommend it. Once I started, I couldn't stop. The narrator brought this story to life for me!I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed T. Kingfisher's work in the past, or anyone who enjoys Southern Gothic tales, or stories that bring humor to Horror. Finally, if you are new to T. Kingfisher, I actually think this would be a strong place to start.Thank you so much to the publisher, Tor Nightfire and Macmillan Audio, for providing me with copies to read and review. I had so much fun with this and can't wait to read it again someday!",203,6
A House with Good Bones,,,,3,"Instagram || Threads || Facebook || Amazon || TikTokI hate to say it since T. Kingfisher is one of my favorite authors and usually I can't get enough of what she writes, but this honestly would have been better as a short story. A HOUSE WITH GOOD BONES is the story of Sam, who goes to her mother's house in rural North Carolina after her brother calls her up and tells her that she seems ""off."" Almost immediately, Sam can see what she means. The changes they've made to the place after Sam's grandmother's death are all gone. The racist Confederate painting is back in its place of pride, the walls have been painted ghastly colors, and the rose bushes are flourishing.Something is very wrong with the house... and with Sam's mom....But what?So one thing I really like about T. Kingfisher is that she's great about writing REALLY creepy stories that end up feeling almost cozy. I don't know how to describe it, except that reading them gives me the same safe-but-scared feeling that I got from reading Point Horror and Goosebumps as a kid. Maybe it's because her heroines are always plucky and affably anxious, and maybe it's because the animal sidekicks almost never die, but even though I'm a wuss when it comes to most gore and horror, I can always pick up her books, no problem.Usually, the atmosphere-to-cozy ratio is perfect but in this book it felt off. The story felt dragged out and silly, and while there were ""good bones"" for a story in this book, the execution really wasn't that great. I loved the fat rep and the fact that the heroine was a bug archaeologist (super neat), and there were a couple ghastly scenes that were worth writing home about, but I left the book feeling pretty disappointed. So far, THE HOLLOW PLACES reigns supreme, followed closely by THE TWISTED ONES. Here's hoping that this was a one-off and that she hasn't lost her magic.2.5 stars",36,0
A House with Good Bones,Melki,"6,310","2,431",4,"The roses say . . . stay away . . . 
There are very few adult children out there who haven't placed a worried phone call (okay, non-boomers - a text) to a sibling posing the age-old query, ""What's going on with Mom?""Sam's mom, Edie, has been behaving strangely. She's stopped swearing, and replaced all the cool artwork in her home with family portraits, and racist wedding prints. It's almost as if she's channeling her own mother, a woman who just wanted things to stay ""nice and normal"". But, NOTHING is normal about Gran Mae's house. Not only are there no bugs in the rose garden . . . there may be some pretty disturbing stuff buried there.That should be enough info to get you itching to read this one. T. Kingfisher is a wonder! She deftly weaves humor and horror into a seamless work of fantastical joy. With this book she's now made the leap to the top of my favorite author heap. I just have to bend the knee to anyone who appreciates vultures as much as I do . . .",42,0
A House with Good Bones,Rachel,395,209,3,"Beware the underground children..Zero to 60 in...well almost 200 of 240 pages, whatever speed that equates to. If only I read in the form of audiobooks. Whoa though, the last 20% of this book was pretty wild. And I enjoyed the *slightly* open ending. Dun dun dunnn🙃HOWEVER, Kingfisher's trademark wit just didn't really work for me in this book. The protagonist veered too slapstick and try-hard, it felt like the reincarnation of everyone's collective great uncle. Please take some of those zany one-liners back to the grave, for the love of roses. I loved that she is a defender of insects though! Scientist protags are cool. I didn't actually mind how slowly we got to our destination and the amount of time we spent in Sam's never-ending inner monologue that didn't have much forward momentum. It was just sort of a shrug reaction from me. Didn't hate it, but certainly wasn't helpful for building suspense. There were small eerie moments like with the mom changing the picture, but we didn't get enough of that. I would have liked more with the mom dealing with the house early on. The threat was a bit too mysterious and mild for quite a while. I like my horror to be more...horrifying though. Which is frustrating, because this book has a genuinely creepy premise and at the end, things do get pretty dark and crazy. But too little too late, so 3 stars it is.I can only hope my deep love of The Hollow Places will be matched by a future book from this writer.",42,0

For me, the only thing missing, was the element of ‘horror’. Yes, there were bugs and blood and buried things and skeletons, etc. but they didn’t make me look under the bed, or check inside the closet or leave the lights on at night. That said, it was an enjoyable read.",42,20

Just kidding  “everything is nice and normal” but if you hate British detective shows and box wine, then first of all… La de daa, and second of all, you and I might be on two different wavelengths with life and this book and that’s okay.

Based on the writing style alone, I knew it would hover around 4 or 5 stars read just a few chapters in.",39,2
